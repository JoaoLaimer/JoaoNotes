## Identifying
### Source Code
When access to the source code is available, identifying serialization vulnerabilities can be more straightforward but requires a keen understanding of what to look for. For example, through code review, we can examine the source code for uses of serialization functions such as `serialize()`, `unserialize()`, `pickle.loads(`), and others. We must pay special attention to any point where user-supplied input might be passed directly to these functions.
### No Access to the Source Code
Here, we focus on detecting patterns in server responses and cookies that might indicate the use of serialization and potential vulnerabilities. As a pentester, appending a tilde `~` at the end of a PHP file name is a common technique attackers use to try to access backup or temporary files created by text editors or version control systems. When a file is edited or saved, some text editors or version control systems may make a backup copy of the original file with a tilde appended to the file name.
#### Analyzing Server Responses
- **Error messages**: Certain error messages can indirectly indicate issues with serialization. For instance, PHP might throw errors or warnings that contain phrases like `unserialize()` or **Object deserialization error**, which are giveaways of underlying serialization processes and potential points of vulnerability.
- **Inconsistencies in application behavior**: Unexpected behavior in response to manipulated input (e.g., modified cookies or POST data) can suggest issues with how data is deserialized and handled. Observing how the application handles altered serialized data can provide clues about potentially vulnerable code.
#### Examining Cookies
- **Base64 encoded values in cookies (PHP and .NET)**: If cookies contain data that looks base64 encoded, decoding it might reveal serialized objects or data structures. PHP often uses serialization for session management and storing session variables in serialized format.
- **ASP.NET view state**: .NET applications might use serialization in the view state sent to the client's browser. A field named `__VIEWSTATE`, which is base64 encoded, can sometimes be seen. Decoding and examining it can reveal whether it contains serialized data that could be exploited.

## Object Injection
Object injection is a vulnerability that arises from insecure data deserialization in web applications. It occurs when untrusted data is deserialized into an object, allowing attackers to manipulate the serialized data to execute arbitrary code, leading to serious security risks.

### Automation Scripts
#### PHP Gadget Chain (PHPGGC)  

 PHPGGC is primarily a tool for generating gadget chains used in PHP object injection attacks, specifically tailored for exploiting vulnerabilities related to PHP object serialization and deserialization. You can download PHPGGC from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ambionics/phpggc).
 **Functionality**
- **Gadget Chains**: PHPGGC provides a library of gadget chains for various PHP frameworks and libraries. These gadget chains are sequences of objects and methods designed to exploit specific vulnerabilities when a PHP application unsafely unserializes user-provided data.  
- **Payload Generation**: The main purpose of PHPGGC is to facilitate the generation of serialized payloads that can trigger these vulnerabilities. It helps security researchers and penetration testers create payloads that demonstrate the impact of insecure deserialization flaws.
- **Payload Customization**: Users can customize payloads by specifying arguments for the functions or methods involved in the gadget chain, thereby tailoring the attack to achieve specific outcomes, such as encoding.

#### Ysoserial for Java
Ysoserial is a widely recognized exploitation tool specifically crafted to test the security of Java applications against serialization vulnerabilities. It helps generate payloads that exploit these vulnerabilities, making it an essential tool for attackers and penetration testers who aim to assess and exploit applications that use Java serialization.

To use Ysoserial, an attacker would typically generate a payload with a command such as `java -jar ysoserial.jar [payload type] '[command to execute]'`, where `[payload type]` is the type of exploit and `[command to execute]` is the arbitrary command they wish to run on the target system. For example, using the `CommonsCollections1` payload type might look like this: `java -jar ysoserial.jar CommonsCollections1 'calc.exe'`. This command generates a serialized object that will execute the specified command when deserialized by a vulnerable application. Ysoserial is available for [download](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) on GitHub.
