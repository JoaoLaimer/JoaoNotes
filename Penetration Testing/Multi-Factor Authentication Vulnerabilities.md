## Weak OTP Generation Algorithms
The security of a One-Time Password (OTP) is only as strong as the algorithm used to create it. If the algorithm is weak or too predictable, the attacker can guess it.
## Application Leaking the 2FA Token
If an application handles data poorly or has vulnerabilities like insecure API endpoints, it might accidentally leak the 2FA token in the application's HTTP response.
A common scenario is when a user, after login, arrives on the 2FA page, the application will trigger an XHR request to an endpoint that issues the OTP. Sometimes, this XHR request returns the OTP back to the user inside the HTTP response.
## Brute Forcing the OTP
Even though OTPs are designed for one-time use, they aren't immune to brute-force attacks. If an attacker can make unlimited guesses, they might eventually get the correct OTP, especially if the OTP isn't well protected by additional security measures.

## Usage of Evilginx
[Evilginx](https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2) is a tool that is typically used in red team engagements. As it can be used to execute sophisticated phishing attacks, effectively bypassing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). It operates as a man-in-the-middle proxy that can intercept and redirect OTPs meant for legitimate users.
How Evilginx works is that when an attacker sends a phishing link to you, and you enter your credentials on what looks like a legitimate login page, Evilginx captures your username, password, and OTP before forwarding them to the real site, giving attackers access using your cookies without needing to crack your MFA.
