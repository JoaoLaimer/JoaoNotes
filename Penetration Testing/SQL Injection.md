**What is SQL Injection?  

The point wherein a web application using SQL can turn into SQL Injection is when user-provided data gets included in the SQL query.  

**What does it look like?**  
Take the following scenario where you've come across an online blog, and each blog entry has a unique ID number. The blog entries may be either set to public or private, depending on whether they're ready for public release. The URL for each blog entry may look something like this:  
  
`https://website.thm/blog?id=1`  
  
From the URL above, you can see that the blog entry selected comes from the id parameter in the query string. The web application needs to retrieve the article from the database and may use an SQL statement that looks something like the following:  
  
`SELECT * from blog where id=1 and private=0 LIMIT 1;`  
  
From what you've learned in the previous task, you should be able to work out that the SQL statement above is looking in the blog table for an article with the id number of 1 and the private column set to 0, which means it's able to be viewed by the public and limits the results to only one match.  
  
As was mentioned at the start of this task, SQL Injection is introduced when user input is introduced into the database query. In this instance, the id parameter from the query string is used directly in the SQL query.  
  
Let's pretend article ID 2 is still locked as private, so it cannot be viewed on the website. We could now instead call the URL:  
   
`https://website.thm/blog?id=2;--`  
  
Which would then, in turn, produce the SQL statement:  
  
`SELECT * from blog where id=2;-- and private=0 LIMIT 1;`  
  
**The semicolon in the URL signifies the end of the SQL statement, and the two dashes cause everything afterwards to be treated as a comment**. By doing this, you're just, in fact, running the query:  
  
`SELECT * from blog where id=2;--`

# In-Band SQLi

In-Band SQL Injection is the easiest type to detect and exploit; In-Band just refers to the same method of communication being used to exploit the vulnerability and also receive the results, for example, discovering an SQL Injection vulnerability on a website page and then being able to extract data from the database to the same page.

# **Error-Based SQL Injection**

This type of SQL Injection is the most useful for easily obtaining information about the database structure, as error messages from the database are printed directly to the browser screen. This can often be used to enumerate a whole database. 


# **Union-Based SQL Injection**

This type of Injection utilises the SQL UNION operator alongside a SELECT statement to return additional results to the page. This method is the most common way of extracting large amounts of data via an SQL Injection vulnerability.

# **Blind SQLi**

Unlike In-Band SQL injection, where we can see the results of our attack directly on the screen, blind SQLi is when we get little to no feedback to confirm whether our injected queries were, in fact, successful or not, this is because the error messages have been disabled, but the injection still works regardless. It might surprise you that all we need is that little bit of feedback to successfully enumerate a whole database.

# **Boolean Based**

Boolean-based SQL Injection refers to the response we receive from our injection attempts, which could be a true/false, yes/no, on/off, 1/0 or any response that can only have two outcomes. That outcome confirms that our SQL Injection payload was either successful or not. On the first inspection, you may feel like this limited response can't provide much information. Still, with just these two responses, it's possible to enumerate a whole database structure and contents.

# **Time-Based**

A time-based blind SQL injection is very similar to the above boolean-based one in that the same requests are sent, but there is no visual indicator of your queries being wrong or right this time. Instead, your indicator of a correct query is based on the time the query takes to complete. This time delay is introduced using built-in methods such as **SLEEP(x)** alongside the UNION statement. The SLEEP() method will only ever get executed upon a successful UNION SELECT statement.
