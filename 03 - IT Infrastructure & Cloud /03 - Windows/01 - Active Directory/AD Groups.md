There are many [built-in groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#about-active-directory-groups) in Active Directory, and most organizations also create their own groups to define rights and privileges, further managing access within the domain.
## Types of Groups
Groups in Active Directory have two fundamental characteristics: `type` and `scope`. The `group type` defines the group's purpose, while the `group scope` shows how the group can be used within the domain or forest. When creating a new group, we must select a group type. There are two main types: `security` and `distribution` groups.
The `Security groups` type is primarily for ease of assigning permissions and rights to a collection of users instead of one at a time. They simplify management and reduce overhead when assigning permissions and rights for a given resource. All users added to a security group will inherit any permissions assigned to the group, making it easier to move users in and out of groups while leaving the group's permissions unchanged.

The `Distribution groups` type is used by email applications such as Microsoft Exchange to distribute messages to group members. They function much like mailing lists and allow for auto-adding emails in the "To" field when creating an email in Microsoft Outlook. This type of group cannot be used to assign permissions to resources in a domain environment.

## Group Scopes

There are three different `group scopes` that can be assigned when creating a new group.

1. Domain Local Group
2. Global Group
3. Universal Group
#### Domain Local Group
Domain local groups can only be used to manage permissions to domain resources in the domain where it was created. Local groups cannot be used in other domains but `CAN` contain users from `OTHER` domains. Local groups can be nested into (contained within) other local groups but `NOT` within global groups.
#### Global Group
Global groups can be used to grant access to resources in `another domain`. A global group can only contain accounts from the domain where it was created. Global groups can be added to both other global groups and local groups.
#### Universal Group

The universal group scope can be used to manage resources distributed across multiple domains and can be given permissions to any object within the same `forest`. They are available to all domains within an organization and can contain users from any domain. Unlike domain local and global groups, universal groups are stored in the Global Catalog (GC), and adding or removing objects from a universal group triggers forest-wide replication. It is recommended that administrators maintain other groups (such as global groups) as members of universal groups because global group membership within universal groups is less likely to change than individual user membership in global groups. Replication is only triggered at the individual domain level when a user is removed from a global group. If individual users and computers (instead of global groups) are maintained within universal groups, it will trigger forest-wide replication each time a change is made. This can create a lot of network overhead and potential for issues. Below is an example of the groups in AD and their scope settings. Please pay attention to some of the critical groups and their scope. ( Enterprise and Schema admins compared to Domain admins, for example.)

Group scopes can be changed, but there are a few caveats:

- A Global Group can only be converted to a Universal Group if it is NOT part of another Global Group.
- A Domain Local Group can only be converted to a Universal Group if the Domain Local Group does NOT contain any other Domain Local Groups as members.
- A Universal Group can be converted to a Domain Local Group without any restrictions.
- A Universal Group can only be converted to a Global Group if it does NOT contain any other Universal Groups as members.
## Nested Group Membership

Nested group membership is an important concept in AD. As mentioned previously, a Domain Local Group can be a member of another Domain Local Group in the same domain. Through this membership, a user may inherit privileges not assigned directly to their account or even the group they are directly a member of, but rather the group that their group is a member of. This can sometimes lead to unintended privileges granted to a user that are difficult to uncover without an in-depth assessment of the domain. Tools such as [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) are particularly useful in uncovering privileges that a user may inherit through one or more nestings of groups. This is a key tool for penetration testers for uncovering nuanced misconfigurations and is also extremely powerful for sysadmins and the like to gain deep insights (visually) into the security posture of their domain(s).

## Important Group Attributes

Like users, groups have many [attributes](http://www.selfadsi.org/group-attributes.htm). Some of the most [important group attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/group-objects) include:

- `cn`: The `cn` or Common-Name is the name of the group in Active Directory Domain Services.
- `member`: Which user, group, and contact objects are members of the group.
- `groupType`: An integer that specifies the group type and scope.
- `memberOf`: A listing of any groups that contain the group as a member (nested group membership).
- `objectSid`: This is the security identifier or SID of the group, which is the unique value used to identify the group as a security principal.

## Built-in AD Groups

AD contains many [default or built-in security groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups), some of which grant their members powerful rights and privileges which can be abused to escalate privileges within a domain and ultimately gain Domain Admin or SYSTEM privileges on a Domain Controller (DC). Membership in many of these groups should be tightly managed as excessive group membership/privileges is a common flaw in many AD networks that attackers look to abuse. Some of the most common built-in groups are listed below.

|Group Name|Description|
|---|---|
|`Account Operators`|Members can create and modify most types of accounts, including those of users, local groups, and global groups, and members can log in locally to domain controllers. They cannot manage the Administrator account, administrative user accounts, or members of the Administrators, Server Operators, Account Operators, Backup Operators, or Print Operators groups.|
|`Administrators`|Members have full and unrestricted access to a computer or an entire domain if they are in this group on a Domain Controller.|
|`Backup Operators`|Members can back up and restore all files on a computer, regardless of the permissions set on the files. Backup Operators can also log on to and shut down the computer. Members can log onto DCs locally and should be considered Domain Admins. They can make shadow copies of the SAM/NTDS database, which, if taken, can be used to extract credentials and other juicy info.|
|`DnsAdmins`|Members have access to network DNS information. The group will only be created if the DNS server role is or was at one time installed on a domain controller in the domain.|
|`Domain Admins`|Members have full access to administer the domain and are members of the local administrator's group on all domain-joined machines.|
|`Domain Computers`|Any computers created in the domain (aside from domain controllers) are added to this group.|
|`Domain Controllers`|Contains all DCs within a domain. New DCs are added to this group automatically.|
|`Domain Guests`|This group includes the domain's built-in Guest account. Members of this group have a domain profile created when signing onto a domain-joined computer as a local guest.|
|`Domain Users`|This group contains all user accounts in a domain. A new user account created in the domain is automatically added to this group.|
|`Enterprise Admins`|Membership in this group provides complete configuration access within the domain. The group only exists in the root domain of an AD forest. Members in this group are granted the ability to make forest-wide changes such as adding a child domain or creating a trust. The Administrator account for the forest root domain is the only member of this group by default.|
|`Event Log Readers`|Members can read event logs on local computers. The group is only created when a host is promoted to a domain controller.|
|`Group Policy Creator Owners`|Members create, edit, or delete Group Policy Objects in the domain.|
|`Hyper-V Administrators`|Members have complete and unrestricted access to all the features in Hyper-V. If there are virtual DCs in the domain, any virtualization admins, such as members of Hyper-V Administrators, should be considered Domain Admins.|
|`IIS_IUSRS`|This is a built-in group used by Internet Information Services (IIS), beginning with IIS 7.0.|
|`Pre–Windows 2000 Compatible Access`|This group exists for backward compatibility for computers running Windows NT 4.0 and earlier. Membership in this group is often a leftover legacy configuration. It can lead to flaws where anyone on the network can read information from AD without requiring a valid AD username and password.|
|`Print Operators`|Members can manage, create, share, and delete printers that are connected to domain controllers in the domain along with any printer objects in AD. Members are allowed to log on to DCs locally and may be used to load a malicious printer driver and escalate privileges within the domain.|
|`Protected Users`|Members of this [group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#protected-users) are provided additional protections against credential theft and tactics such as Kerberos abuse.|
|`Read-only Domain Controllers`|Contains all Read-only domain controllers in the domain.|
|`Remote Desktop Users`|This group is used to grant users and groups permission to connect to a host via Remote Desktop (RDP). This group cannot be renamed, deleted, or moved.|
|`Remote Management Users`|This group can be used to grant users remote access to computers via [Windows Remote Management (WinRM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/portal)|
|`Schema Admins`|Members can modify the Active Directory schema, which is the way all objects with AD are defined. This group only exists in the root domain of an AD forest. The Administrator account for the forest root domain is the only member of this group by default.|
|`Server Operators`|This group only exists on domain controllers. Members can modify services, access SMB shares, and backup files on domain controllers. By default, this group has no members.|
## Viewing a User's Privileges

After logging into a host, typing the command `whoami /priv` will give us a listing of all user rights assigned to the current user.
