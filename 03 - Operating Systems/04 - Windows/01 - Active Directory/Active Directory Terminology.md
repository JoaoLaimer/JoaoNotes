### Object
An object can be defined as ANY resource present within an [[Active Directory ]]environment, such as OUs, printers, users, domain controllers, etc.
### Attributes
Every object has an associated set of attributes. All attributes in AD have an associated LDAP name that can be used when performing LDAP queries, such as displayName for full name and given name for first name.
### Schema
The Active Directory [schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/schema) is essentially the blueprint of any enterprise environment. It defines what types of objects can exist in the AD database and their associated attributes. It lists definitions corresponding to AD objects and holds information about each object. For example, users in AD belong to the class "user," and computer objects to "computer," and so on.
### Domain
A domain is a logical group of objects such as computers, users, OUs, groups, etc. We can think of each domain as a different city within a state or country. Domains can operate entirely independently of one another or be connected via trust relationships.
### Forest
A forest is a collection of Active Directory domains. It is the topmost container and contains all of the AD objects introduced below, including but not limited to domains, users, groups, computers, and Group Policy objects. Each forest operates independently but may have various trust relationships with other forests.
### Tree
A tree is a collection of Active Directory domains that begins at a single root domain. A forest is a collection of AD trees. Each domain in a tree shares a boundary with the other domains. A parent-child trust relationship is formed when a domain is added under another domain in a tree. Two trees in the same forest cannot share a name (namespace).
#### Container
Container objects hold other objects and have a defined place in the directory subtree hierarchy.
#### Leaf
Leaf objects do not contain other objects and are found at the end of the subtree hierarchy.
#### Global Unique Identifier (GUID)
A [GUID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-objectguid) is a unique 128-bit value assigned when a domain user or group is created. This GUID value is unique across the enterprise, similar to a MAC address. Every single object created by Active Directory is assigned a GUID, not only user and group objects. The GUID is stored in the `ObjectGUID` attribute. When querying for an AD object (such as a user, group, computer, domain, domain controller, etc.), we can query for its `objectGUID` value using PowerShell or search for it by specifying its distinguished name, GUID, SID, or SAM account name. The `ObjectGUID` property `never` changes and is associated with the object for as long as that object exists in the domain.
#### Security principals
[Security principals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-principals) are anything that the operating system can authenticate, including users, computer accounts, or even threads/processes that run in the context of a user or computer account (i.e., an application such as Tomcat running in the context of a service account within the domain). In AD, security principles are domain objects that can manage access to other resources within the domain. These are not managed by AD but rather by the [Security Accounts Manager (SAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Account_Manager).
#### Security Identifier (SID)
A [security identifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-principals), or SID is used as a unique identifier for a security principal or security group. Every account, group, or process has its own unique SID, which, in an AD environment, is issued by the domain controller and stored in a secure database. There are also [well-known SIDs](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Well-known%20Security%20Identifiers) that are used to identify generic users and groups. These are the same across all operating systems. An example is the `Everyone` group.
#### Distinguished Name (DN)
A [Distinguished Name (DN)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ldap/distinguished-names) describes the full path to an object in AD (such as `cn=bjones, ou=IT, ou=Employees, dc=inlanefreight, dc=local`). In this example, the user `bjones` works in the IT department of the company Inlanefreight, and his account is created in an Organizational Unit (OU) that holds accounts for company employees.
#### Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)
A [Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/object-names-and-identities) is a single component of the Distinguished Name that identifies the object as unique from other objects at the current level in the naming hierarchy. In our example, `bjones` is the Relative Distinguished Name of the object. AD does not allow two objects with the same name under the same parent container, but there can be two objects with the same RDNs that are still unique in the domain because they have different DNs. For example, the object `cn=bjones,dc=dev,dc=inlanefreight,dc=local` would be recognized as different from `cn=bjones,dc=inlanefreight,dc=local`.
#### sAMAccountName
The [sAMAccountName](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/naming-properties#samaccountname) is the user's logon name. Here it would just be `bjones`. It must be a unique value and 20 or fewer characters.
#### userPrincipalName
The [userPrincipalName](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/52250.active-directory-user-principal-name.aspx) attribute is another way to identify users in AD. This attribute consists of a prefix (the user account name) and a suffix (the domain name) in the format of `bjones@inlanefreight.local`. This attribute is not mandatory.
#### FSMO Roles
[Flexible Single Master Operation (FSMO)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/fsmo-roles) give Domain Controllers (DC) the ability to continue authenticating users and granting permissions without interruption (authorization and authentication). There are five FSMO roles: `Schema Master` and `Domain Naming Master` (one of each per forest), `Relative ID (RID) Master` (one per domain), `Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator` (one per domain), and `Infrastructure Master` (one per domain). All five roles are assigned to the first DC in the forest root domain in a new AD forest.
#### Global Catalog
A [global catalog (GC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/global-catalog) is a domain controller that stores copies of ALL objects in an Active Directory forest. The GC stores a full copy of all objects in the current domain and a partial copy of objects that belong to other domains in the forest. Standard domain controllers hold a complete replica of objects belonging to its domain but not those of different domains in the forest. The GC allows both users and applications to find information about any objects in ANY domain in the forest. GC is a feature that is enabled on a domain controller and performs the following functions:

- Authentication (provided authorization for all groups that a user account belongs to, which is included when an access token is generated)
- Object search (making the directory structure within a forest transparent, allowing a search to be carried out across all domains in a forest by providing just one attribute about an object.)
#### Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)
A [Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/rodc-and-active-directory-schema) has a read-only Active Directory database. No AD account passwords are cached on an RODC (other than the RODC computer account & RODC KRBTGT passwords.)
#### Replication
[Replication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/replication/active-directory-replication-concepts) happens in AD when AD objects are updated and transferred from one Domain Controller to another. Whenever a DC is added, connection objects are created to manage replication between them. These connections are made by the Knowledge Consistency Checker (KCC) service, which is present on all DCs. Replication ensures that changes are synchronized with all other DCs in a forest, helping to create a backup in case one domain controller fails.
#### Service Principal Name (SPN)
A [Service Principal Name (SPN)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/service-principal-names) uniquely identifies a service instance. They are used by Kerberos authentication to associate an instance of a service with a logon account, allowing a client application to request the service to authenticate an account without needing to know the account name.
#### Group Policy Object (GPO)
[Group Policy Objects (GPOs)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/policy/group-policy-objects) are virtual collections of policy settings. Each GPO has a unique GUID. A GPO can contain local file system settings or Active Directory settings. GPO settings can be applied to both user and computer objects.
#### Access Control List (ACL)
An [Access Control List (ACL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists) is the ordered collection of Access Control Entries (ACEs) that apply to an object.
#### Access Control Entries (ACEs)
Each [Access Control Entry (ACE)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-entries) in an ACL identifies a trustee (user account, group account, or logon session) and lists the access rights that are allowed, denied, or audited for the given trustee.
#### Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)
DACLs define which security principles are granted or denied access to an object; it contains a list of ACEs. When a process tries to access a securable object, the system checks the ACEs in the object's DACL to determine whether or not to grant access. If an object does NOT have a DACL, then the system will grant full access to everyone, but if the DACL has no ACE entries, the system will deny all access attempts.
#### System Access Control Lists (SACL)
Allows for administrators to log access attempts that are made to secured objects
#### Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
An FQDN is the complete name for a specific computer or host. It is written with the hostname and domain name in the format:
- (host name).(domain name).(tld)
#### Tombstone
A [tombstone](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Tombstone) is a container object in AD that holds deleted AD objects. When an object is deleted from AD, the object remains for a set period of time known as the `Tombstone Lifetime,` and the `isDeleted` attribute is set to `TRUE`. Once an object exceeds the `Tombstone Lifetime`, it will be entirely removed.
#### AD Recycle Bin
The [AD Recycle Bin](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ask-the-directory-services-team/the-ad-recycle-bin-understanding-implementing-best-practices-and/ba-p/396944) was first introduced in Windows Server 2008 R2 to facilitate the recovery of deleted AD objects. This made it easier for sysadmins to restore objects, avoiding the need to restore from backups, restarting Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), or rebooting a Domain Controller.
#### SYSVOL
The [SYSVOL](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/8548.active-directory-sysvol-and-netlogon.aspx) folder, or share, stores copies of public files in the domain such as system policies, Group Policy settings, logon/logoff scripts, and often contains other types of scripts that are executed to perform various tasks in the AD environment. The contents of the SYSVOL folder are replicated to all DCs within the environment using File Replication Services (FRS). You can read more about the SYSVOL structure [here](https://networkencyclopedia.com/sysvol-share/#Components-and-Structure).
#### AdminSDHolder
The [AdminSDHolder](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/appendix-c--protected-accounts-and-groups-in-active-directory) object is used to manage ACLs for members of built-in groups in AD marked as privileged. It acts as a container that holds the Security Descriptor applied to members of protected groups. The SDProp (SD Propagator) process runs on a schedule on the PDC Emulator Domain Controller. When this process runs, it checks members of protected groups to ensure that the correct ACL is applied to them. It runs every hour by default.
#### dsHeuristics
The [dsHeuristics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-dsheuristics) attribute is a string value set on the Directory Service object used to define multiple forest-wide configuration settings. One of these settings is to exclude built-in groups from the [Protected Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/appendix-c--protected-accounts-and-groups-in-active-directory) list. Groups in this list are protected from modification via the `AdminSDHolder` object. If a group is excluded via the `dsHeuristics` attribute, then any changes that affect it will not be reverted when the SDProp process runs.
#### adminCount
The [adminCount](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-admincount) attribute determines whether or not the SDProp process protects a user. If the value is set to `0` or not specified, the user is not protected. If the attribute value is set to `1`, the user is protected. Attackers will often look for accounts with the `adminCount` attribute set to `1` to target in an internal environment. These are often privileged accounts and may lead to further access or full domain compromise.
#### Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)
ADUC is a GUI console commonly used for managing users, groups, computers, and contacts in AD. Changes made in ADUC can be done via PowerShell as well.
#### ADSI Edit
ADSI Edit is a GUI tool used to manage objects in AD. It provides access to far more than is available in ADUC and can be used to set or delete any attribute available on an object, add, remove, and move objects as well.
#### sIDHistory
[This](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/cas-isp-unsecure-sid-history-attribute) attribute holds any SIDs that an object was assigned previously. It is usually used in migrations so a user can maintain the same level of access when migrated from one domain to another.
#### NTDS.DIT
The NTDS.DIT file can be considered the heart of Active Directory. It is stored on a Domain Controller at `C:\Windows\NTDS\` and is a database that stores AD data such as information about user and group objects, group membership, and, most important to attackers and penetration testers, the password hashes for all users in the domain. Once full domain compromise is reached, an attacker can retrieve this file, extract the hashes, and either use them to perform a pass-the-hash attack or crack them offline using a tool such as Hashcat to access additional resources in the domain.
#### MSBROWSE

MSBROWSE is a Microsoft networking protocol that was used in early versions of Windows-based local area networks (LANs) to provide browsing services. It was used to maintain a list of resources, such as shared printers and files, that were available on the network, and to allow users to easily browse and access these resources.

In older version of Windows we could use `nbtstat -A ip-address` to search for the Master Browser. If we see MSBROWSE it means that's the Master Browser. Aditionally we could use `nltest` utility to query a Windows Master Browser for the names of the Domain Controllers.

Today, MSBROWSE is largely obsolete and is no longer in widespread use.
