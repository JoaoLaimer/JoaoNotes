## Cryptography
Practice and study of writing and solving codes to hide the true meaning of the information.
## Encryption
Process of converting ordinary information (plaintext) into an unintelligible form (ciphertext).
- Data at Rest: Inactive data that is being archived
- Data in Transit: Data that moves across the network, resides inside RAM, or moves to and from the processor.
- Data in Use: Data undergoing a current constant state of change.
## [[Symmetric vs Asymmetric]]
- ### [[Symmetric Algorithms]]
	Use the same key for both encryption and decryption.
	- DES
	- 3DES
	- IDEA
	- AES
	- Blowfish
	- Twofish
- ### [[Asymmetric Algorithms]]
	Use a pair of keys, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
	- Diffie-Hellman
	- RSA
	- Elliptic Curve
## [[Hashing]]
Process that convert data into a fixed size string of characters called message digest using a hash function.
- MD5
- SHA
- RIPEMD
- HMAC
## Increasing Hash Security
## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
Framework for managing digital keys and certificates to ensure secure data transfer and authentication occurs.
## Digital Certificates
Electronic credentials issued by a trusted authority that verifies the identity of an entity and provides a menas to establish secure communications. 
- #### Exploring Digital Certificates
## Blockchain
Decentralized, immutable ledger that records transactions across multiple computers to ensure data integrity and transparency.
## Encryption Tools
- TPM
- HSM
- Key management systems
- Secure enclaves
## Obfuscation
- Steganography: practice of hiding data within ordinary non-secret files or messages
- Tokenization: substituting sensitive data with nonsensitive equivalents called tokens.
- Data masking: process of disguising original data to protect sensitive information while maintaining its authenticity.
