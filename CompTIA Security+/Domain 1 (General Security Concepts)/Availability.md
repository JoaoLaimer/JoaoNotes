- Upholding and Organization's Reputation.

# How to achieve Availability
## Redundancy
Duplication of critical components or functions of a system with the intention of enhancing its reliability.
#### Server Redundancy
Involves using multiple servers in a load balance so that if one is overloaded or fails, the other servers can take over the load to continue supporting end users.
#### Data Redundancy
Involves storing data in multiple places
#### Network Redundancy
Ensures that if one network path fails, the data can travel through another route.
#### Power Redundancy
Involves using backup power sources to ensure that an organization's system remain operational during periods of power disruption or outages within a local service area.
