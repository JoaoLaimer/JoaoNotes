Method of encryption where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption of data.
## Data Encryption Standard(DES)
Encryption algorithm which breaks the input into 64-bit blocks and uses transposition and substitution to create ciphertext using an effective key strength of only 56-bits.
## Triple DES (3DES)
Encryption algorithm which uses three separate symmetric keys to encrypt, decrypt, then encrypt the plaintext into ciphertext in order to increase the strength of DES. It uses a 112-bit key.
## International Data encryption Algorithm (IDEA)
Symmetric block cipher, which uses 64-bit blocks to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext, used in PGP.
## Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
Symmetric block cipher that uses 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit blocks and a matching encryption key size to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext, also called the Rjindael algorithm, is the defacto standard in encryption.
## Blowfish
Symmetric block cipher that uses 64-bit blocks and a variable length encryption key to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext.
## Twofish
Provides the ability to use 128-bit blocks in its encryption algorithm and uses 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit encryption keys.
## RC Cipher Suite
Created by Ron Rivest, a cryptographer who's created six algorithms under the name RC which stands for the Rivest Cipher
#### Rivest Cipher (RC4)
Symmetric stream cipher using a variable key size from 40-bits to 2048-bits that is used in SSL and WEP.
#### RC5
Symmetric block cipher that uses key sizes up to 2048-bits
#### RC6
Symmetric block cipher that was introduced as a replacement for DES but AES was chosen instead.
