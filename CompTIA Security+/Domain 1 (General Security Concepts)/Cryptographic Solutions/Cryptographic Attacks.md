Techniques and strategies that adversaries employ to exploit vulnerabilities in cryptographic systems with the intent to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or authenticity of data.
## Downgrade Attacks
Aims to force a system into using a weaker or older cryptographic standard protocol than what it's currently utilizing.
POODLE attack, also known as the Padding Oracle ON Downgraded Legacy Encryption attack, which targeted SSL version 3.0
## Collision Attack
Aims to find two different inputs that produce the same hash output.
- Birthday Attack
## Quantum Computing
A computer that uses quantum mechanics to generate and manipulate quantum bits (qubits) in order to access enormous processing power.
### Quantum Communication
A communications network that relies on qubits made of photons (light) to send multiple combinations of ones and zeros simultaneously which results in tamper resistant and extremely fast communication.
#### Qubit
A quantum bit composed of electrons or photons that can represent numerous combinations of ones and zeros at the same time through superposition.
It's designed for very specific use cases, such as very complex math problems or trying to do something like the modeling of an atom or some kind of atomic structure.
## Post-Quantum Cryptography
A new kind of cryptography algorithm that can be implemented  using today's classical computers but is also impervious to attacks from future quantum computers.
