## Symmetric Algorithm (Private Key)
Encryption algorithm in which both the sender and the receiver must know the same shared secret using a privately held key.
## Asymmetric Algorithm (Public Key)
Encryption algorithm where different keys are used to encrypt and decrypt the data.
## Hybrid Implementation
Utilizes asymmetric encryption to securely transfer a private key that can then be used with symmetric encryption.
## Stream Cipher
Utilizes a keystream generator to encrypt data bit by bit using a mathematical XOR function to create the ciphertext.
## Block Cipher
Breaks the input into fixed-length blocks of data and performs the encryption on each block.
