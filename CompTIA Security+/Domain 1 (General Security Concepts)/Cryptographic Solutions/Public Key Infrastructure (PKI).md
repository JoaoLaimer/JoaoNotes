An entire system of hardware, software, policies, procedures, and people that is based on asymmetric encryption.
System that creates the asymmetrical key pairs that consist of those public and private keys that are used in the encryption and decryption process.
## Public Key Cryptography
This encryption and decryption process is just one small part of the whole PKI process.
## Certificate Authority
Issues digital certificates and keeps the level of trust between all of the certificate authorities around the world.
## Key Escrow
Process where cryptographic keys are stored in a secure, third-party location, which is effectively an "escrow".
