# Biometrics
## False Acceptance Rate (FAR)
The rate that the system authenticates a user as valid, even though that person should not have been granted access to the system.
## False Rejection Rate (FRR)
Occurs any time the biometrics system denies a user who should been allowed access to the system.
## Equal Error Rate (EER)
More commonly called Crossover Error Rate (CER), which uses a measure of effectiveness of a given biometrics system to achieve balance.

# Cipher Lock
Provides excellent protection using a mechanical locking mechanism with push buttons that are numbered and require a person to enter the correct combination in order to open that door.
