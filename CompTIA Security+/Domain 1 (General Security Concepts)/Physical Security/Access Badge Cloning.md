One of the most prevalent vulnerabilities you need to be aware of in term of the RFID and NFC technologies is the ability to easily conduct access badge cloning to bypass your authentication systems.
1. The attacker can use a handheld device RFID or NFC reader to capture data from a victim's card and store it for further processing.
2. Once the data is captured, attackers can extract the relevant authentication credentials from the card.
3. Using specialized writing tools, the attacker will then transfer the extracted data into a blank RFID or NFC card.
4. Now the attacker can gain unauthorized access or even make payments.

## How to prevent it
1. Implement advanced encryption in card-based  authentication system.
2. Implement Multi-factor authentication.
3. Regularly update the security protocols.
4. Educate the users.
5. Users should implement the use of shielded wallets or sleeves with RFID access badges.
6. Monitor and audit access logs.
