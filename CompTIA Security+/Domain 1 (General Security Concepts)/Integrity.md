Helps to ensure information and data remain accurate and unchanged from their original state unless intentionally modified by an authorized individual.
Integrity verifies the accuracy and trustworthiness of data over the entire life cycle.

### Objectives 
Ensure Data Accuracy.
Maintain Trust.
Ensure System Operability.

Maintaining data integrity ensures that decisions are made based on correct information and with the expected outcomes.

## How to achieve Integrity:

### Hashing
Process of converting data into a fixed-size value.
The hash digest serves as a digital fingerprint of data.

### Digital Signatures
Use encryption to ensure integrity and authenticity.

### Checksum
Method to verify the integrity of data during transmission.

### Access Controls
Ensure that only authorized individuals can modify data and reduce the risk of unintentional or malicious alterations.

### Regular Audits
Involve reviewing logs and operations to ensure that only authorized changes have been made and any discrepancies are addressed.
