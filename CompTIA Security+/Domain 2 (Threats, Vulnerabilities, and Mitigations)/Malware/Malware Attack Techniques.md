## Exploit Technique
Describes the specific method by which malware code infects a target host.

Some malware focuses on infecting the system's memory to leverage remote procedure calls over the organization's network.
Most modern malware uses fileless techniques to avoid detection by signature-based security software.
### Fileless Malware
Used to create a process in the system memory without relying on the local file system of the infected host.

## Stage 1: Dropper or Downloader
When a user clicks on a malicious link or opens a malicious file, malware is installed.
### Stage 2: Downloader
Download and install a remote access Trojan to conduct command and control on the victimized system.
### "Actions on Objectives" Phase
Threat actor will execute primary objectives to meet core objectives (data exfiltration or file encryption).
## Concealment 
Used to help the threat actor prolong unauthorized access to a system by hiding tracks, erasing log files, and hiding any evidence of malicious activities.

- Code Injection
- DLL Sideloading 
- Masquerading
- DLL Injection
- Process Hollowing

## "Living Off the land"
A strategy adopted by many APTs, the actors try to exploit the standard system tools to perform intrusions.
