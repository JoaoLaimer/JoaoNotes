Malware needs to create a threat vector and an attack vector.
## Threat Vector
Specific method used by an attacker to infiltrate a victim's machine.
- Unpatched software
- Installing code
- Phishing campaign
- Other vulnerabilities
## Attack Vector
A means by which an attacker gains access to a computer to infect the system with malware.
## Difference
**Threat Vector**: Breaks into the system.
**Attack Vector**: Breaks into and infect the system.
## [[Viruses]]
Malicious software that attaches to clean files and spreads into a computes system.
## [[Worms]]
Standalone malware programs that replicate and spread to other systems by exploiting software vulnerabilities.
## [[Trojans]]
Malicious program which appear to be legitimate software that allow unauthorized access to a victim's system when executed.
## Viruses and Trojans
## [[Ransomware]]
Encrypts a user's data and holds it hostage until a ransom is paid to the attacker for decryption.
## [[Zombies and Botnets]]
### Zombies
Compromised computers that are remotely controlled by attackers and used in coordination to form a botnet.
### Botnets
Network of zombies and are often used for DDoS attacks, spam distribution, or cryptocurrency mining.
## Rootkits
Malicious tools that hide their activities and operate at the OS level to allow for ongoing privileged access.
## Backdoors and Logic Bomb
### Backdoors
Malicious means of bypassing normal authentication processes to gain unauthorized access to a system.
## Logic Bomb
Embed code placed in legitimate program that executes a malicious action when a specific condition or trigger occurs.
## Keyloggers 
Record a user's keystrokes and are used to capture passwords or other sensitive information.
## Spyware
Secretly monitor and gathers user information or activities and sends data to third parties.
## Bloatware
Unnecessary or preinstalled software that consumes system resources and space without offering any value to the user.
## Malware Attack Techniques
### Malware Exploitation Techniques
Involve methods by which malware infiltrates and infects targeted systems.
