MISP is an open-source threat information platform that facilitates collection, storage and distribution of threat intelligence and IOCs .
MISP is effectively useful for:
- **Malware Reverse Engineering**: Sharing malware indicators to understand how different malware families function.
- **Security Investigations**: Searching, validating, and using indicators in investigating security breaches.
- **Intelligence Analysis**: Gathering information about adversary groups and their capabilities.
- **Law Enforcement:** Using Indicators to support forensic investigations.
- **Risk Analysis:** Researching new threats, their likelihood and occurrences.
- **Fraud Analysis:** Sharing of financial indicators to detect financial fraud.
MISP provides the following core functionalities: 
- **IOC database:** This allows for the storage of technical and non-technical information about malware samples, incidents, attackers and intelligence.
- **Automatic Correlation:** Identification of relationships between attributes and indicators from malware, attack campaigns or analysis.
- **Data Sharing:** This allows for sharing of information using different models of distributions and among different MISP instances.
- **Import & Export Features:** This allows the import and export of events in different formats to integrate other systems such as NIDS, HIDS, and OpenIOC.
- **Event Graph:** Showcases the relationships between objects and attributes identified from events.
- **API support:** Supports integration with own systems to fetch and export events and intelligence.
The following terms are used within MISP:
- **Events:** Collection of contextually linked information.
- **Attributes:** Individual data points associated with an event, such as network or system indicators.
- **Objects:** Custom attribute compositions.
- **Object References:** Relationships between different objects.
- **Sightings:** Time-specific occurrences of a given data point or attribute detected to provide more credibility.
- **Tags:** Labels attached to events/attributes.
- **Taxonomies:** Classification libraries are used to tag, classify and organise information.
- **Galaxies:** Knowledge base items used to label events/attributes.
- **Indicators:** Pieces of information that can detect suspicious or malicious cyber activity.
**MISP GUI**
- **Home button:** Returns you to the application's start screen, the event index page or the page set as a custom home page using the star in the top bar.
- **Event Actions:** All the malware data entered into MISP comprises an event object described by its connected attributes. The Event actions menu gives access to all the functionality related to the creation, modification, deletion, publishing, searching and listing of events and attributes.
- **Dashboard:** This allows you to create a custom dashboard using widgets.
- **Galaxies:** Shortcut to the list of [MISP Galaxies](https://github.com/MISP/misp-book/blob/main/galaxy) on the MISP instance. More on these on the Feeds & Taxonomies Task.
- **Input Filters:** Input filters alter how users enter data into this instance. Apart from the basic validation of attribute entry by type, the site administrators can define regular expression replacements and blocklists for specific values and block certain values from being exportable. Users can view these replacement and blocklist rules here, while an administrator can alter them.
- **Global Actions:** Access to information about MISP and this instance. You can view and edit your profile, view the manual, read the news or the terms of use again, see a list of the active organisations on this instance and a histogram of their contributions by an attribute type.
- **MISP:** Simple link to your baseurl.
- **Name:** Name (Auto-generated from Mail address) of currently logged in user.
- **Envelope:** Link to User Dashboard to consult some of your notifications and changes since the last visit. Like some of the proposals received for your organisation.
- **Log out:** The Log out button to end your session immediately.
