 Vulnerability management is an ongoing, proactive, and frequently automated activity that protects computer systems, networks, and enterprise solutions from cyberattacks and data breaches. Consequently, it is a vital component of an overall security program. By discovering, evaluating, and correcting potential security flaws, businesses can help avoid attacks and mitigate their effects if they occur.

## Vulnerability Classification
The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) standard components are as follows:
- **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE):** [MITRE](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/) maintains the CVE list of publicly documented vulnerabilities and exposures. Each of the CVEs identifies a vulnerability that may be exploited to launch an attack. With a unique identifier, a description, and at least one public reference, CVE seeks to standardise the identification of security vulnerabilities. Anyone can access the CVE system at no cost, making it a valuable resource for security management professionals and organizations. [CVE Details](https://www.cvedetails.com/) is also a renowned website for searching CVEs and their impact.
-  **Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE):** A CCE gives system configuration issues unique identifiers to quickly and accurately link configuration data from different information sources and tools. For instance, CCE identifiers can be used to match up configuration assessment tool results with recommended best practices. This is comparable to the CVE list, which gives publicly reported system vulnerability IDs.
- **Common Platform Enumeration (CPE):** CPE is a method for classifying and identifying devices, operating systems (OS), and application types inside an infrastructure. CPE is widely used in security and vulnerability management tools to identify various assets and to take accurate automated decisions through correlation with CVE and CCE.
- **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):** CVSS is a scoring system that rates the severity of vulnerabilities and identifies their characteristics. It assigns severity scores to all defined vulnerabilities, which is used to prioritise mitigation efforts and the required resources based on the severity. The range of possible scores is 0 to 10, with 10 representing the most severe.

## Vulnerability Management Lifecycle
There are six essential phases in the vulnerability management lifecycle that can be mapped out from the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework); each includes its sub-processes and activities. These stages can be used by organisations wishing to develop or enhance their vulnerability management program.
