Per the official Velociraptor [documentation](https://docs.velociraptor.app/docs/overview/), "_Velociraptor is a unique, advanced open-source endpoint monitoring, digital forensic and cyber response platform._ _It was developed by Digital Forensic and Incident Response (DFIR) professionals who needed a powerful and efficient way to hunt for specific artifacts and monitor activities across fleets of endpoints. Velociraptor provides you with the ability to more effectively respond to a wide range of digital forensic and cyber incident response investigations and data breaches_".
The Velociraptor executable can act as a **server** or a **client** and it can run on **Windows**, **Linux**, and **MacOS**.  Velociraptor is also compatible with cloud file systems, such as **Amazon EFS** and **Google Filestore**.

**Velociraptor Query Language**

Per the official [documentation](https://docs.velociraptor.app/docs/overview/#vql---the-velociraptor-difference), "_Velociraptor’s power and flexibility comes from the Velociraptor Query Language (VQL). VQL is a framework for creating highly customized artifacts, which allow you to collect, query, and monitor almost any aspect of an endpoint, groups of endpoints, or an entire network. It can also be used to create continuous monitoring rules on the endpoint, as well as automate tasks on the server_".

With many tools that you will encounter in your SOC career, some tools may have their own query language. For example, in Splunk its SPL ([Search Processing Language](https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:SPL#:~:text=abbreviation,functions%2C%20arguments%2C%20and%20clauses.)), Elastic has KQL ([Kibana Query Language](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/kuery-query.html)), Microsoft Sentinel has KQL [too] ([Kusto Query Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/kusto-overview)), etc.
