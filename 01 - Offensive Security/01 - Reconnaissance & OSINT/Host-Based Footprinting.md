# FTP & TFTP
Let us take a look at a few commands of `TFTP`:

|**Commands**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`connect`|Sets the remote host, and optionally the port, for file transfers.|
|`get`|Transfers a file or set of files from the remote host to the local host.|
|`put`|Transfers a file or set of files from the local host onto the remote host.|
|`quit`|Exits tftp.|
|`status`|Shows the current status of tftp, including the current transfer mode (ascii or binary), connection status, time-out value, and so on.|
|`verbose`|Turns verbose mode, which displays additional information during file transfer, on or off.|
## Default Configuration
#### vsFTPd Config File

```
JoaoLaimer@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/vsftpd.conf | grep -v "#"`
```

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`listen=NO`|Run from inetd or as a standalone daemon?|
|`listen_ipv6=YES`|Listen on IPv6 ?|
|`anonymous_enable=NO`|Enable Anonymous access?|
|`local_enable=YES`|Allow local users to login?|
|`dirmessage_enable=YES`|Display active directory messages when users go into certain directories?|
|`use_localtime=YES`|Use local time?|
|`xferlog_enable=YES`|Activate logging of uploads/downloads?|
|`connect_from_port_20=YES`|Connect from port 20?|
|`secure_chroot_dir=/var/run/vsftpd/empty`|Name of an empty directory|
|`pam_service_name=vsftpd`|This string is the name of the PAM service vsftpd will use.|
|`rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem`|The last three options specify the location of the RSA certificate to use for SSL encrypted connections.|
|`rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key`||
|`ssl_enable=NO`||
In addition, there is a file called `/etc/ftpusers` that we also need to pay attention to.

## Dangerous Settings
|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`anonymous_enable=YES`|Allowing anonymous login?|
|`anon_upload_enable=YES`|Allowing anonymous to upload files?|
|`anon_mkdir_write_enable=YES`|Allowing anonymous to create new directories?|
|`no_anon_password=YES`|Do not ask anonymous for password?|
|`anon_root=/home/username/ftp`|Directory for anonymous.|
|`write_enable=YES`|Allow the usage of FTP commands: STOR, DELE, RNFR, RNTO, MKD, RMD, APPE, and SITE?|

Some commands should be used occasionally, as these will make the server show us more information that we can use for our purposes. These commands include `status`, `debug` and `trace`.

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`dirmessage_enable=YES`|Show a message when they first enter a new directory?|
|`chown_uploads=YES`|Change ownership of anonymously uploaded files?|
|`chown_username=username`|User who is given ownership of anonymously uploaded files.|
|`local_enable=YES`|Enable local users to login?|
|`chroot_local_user=YES`|Place local users into their home directory?|
|`chroot_list_enable=YES`|Use a list of local users that will be placed in their home directory?|

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`hide_ids=YES`|All user and group information in directory listings will be displayed as "ftp".|
|`ls_recurse_enable=YES`|Allows the use of recurse listings.|

Another helpful setting we can use for our purposes is the `ls_recurse_enable=YES`.
```
ftp> ls -R
```
We also can download all the files and folders we have access to at once.
```
$ wget -m --no-passive ftp://anonymous:anonymous@10.129.14.136
```
With the `PUT` command, we can upload files in the current folder to the FTP server.

## Footprinting the Service
#### Nmap FTP Scripts
```
$ sudo nmap --script-updatedb
```
#### Service Interaction
```
$ nc -nv 10.129.14.136 21
```
```
$ telnet 10.129.14.136 21
```
It looks slightly different if the FTP server runs with TLS/SSL encryption. Because then we need a client that can handle TLS/SSL. For this, we can use the client `openssl` and communicate with the FTP server. The good thing about using `openssl` is that we can see the SSL certificate, which can also be helpful.

```
$ openssl s_client -connect 10.129.14.136:21 -starttls ftp
```

# SMB
## Samba

As mentioned earlier, there is an alternative implementation of the SMB server called Samba, which is developed for Unix-based operating systems. Samba implements the Common Internet File System (`CIFS`) network protocol. [CIFS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-cifs/934c2faa-54af-4526-ac74-6a24d126724e) is a dialect of SMB, meaning it is a specific implementation of the SMB protocol originally created by Microsoft. This allows Samba to communicate effectively with newer Windows systems. Therefore, it is often referred to as SMB/CIFS.

`CIFS` is considered a specific version of the SMB protocol, primarily aligning with `SMB version 1`. When SMB commands are transmitted over Samba to an older NetBIOS service, connections typically occur over TCP ports `137`, `138`, and `139`. In contrast, CIFS operates over TCP port `445` exclusively

| **SMB Version** | **Supported**                       | **Features**                                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CIFS            | Windows NT 4.0                      | Communication via NetBIOS interface                                    |
| SMB 1.0         | Windows 2000                        | Direct connection via TCP                                              |
| SMB 2.0         | Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008  | Performance upgrades, improved message signing, caching feature        |
| SMB 2.1         | Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2   | Locking mechanisms                                                     |
| SMB 3.0         | Windows 8, Windows Server 2012      | Multichannel connections, end-to-end encryption, remote storage access |
| SMB 3.0.2       | Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2 |                                                                        |
| SMB 3.1.1       | Windows 10, Windows Server 2016     | Integrity checking, AES-128 encryption                                 |
A workgroup is a group name that identifies an arbitrary collection of computers and their resources on an SMB network. There can be multiple workgroups on the network at any given time. IBM developed an `application programming interface` (`API`) for networking computers called the `Network Basic Input/Output System` (`NetBIOS`).
In a NetBIOS environment, when a machine goes online, it needs a name, which is done through the so-called `name registration` procedure.Either each host reserves its hostname on the network, or the [NetBIOS Name Server](https://networkencyclopedia.com/netbios-name-server-nbns/) (`NBNS`) is used for this purpose. It also has been enhanced to [Windows Internet Name Service](https://networkencyclopedia.com/windows-internet-name-service-wins/) (`WINS`).
## Default Configuration
```
$ cat /etc/samba/smb.conf | grep -v "#\|\;" 

[global]
   workgroup = DEV.INFREIGHT.HTB
   server string = DEVSMB
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
   max log size = 1000
   logging = file
   panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d

   server role = standalone server
   obey pam restrictions = yes
   unix password sync = yes

   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
   passwd chat = *Enter\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *password\supdated\ssuccessfully* .

   pam password change = yes
   map to guest = bad user
   usershare allow guests = yes

[printers]
   comment = All Printers
   browseable = no
   path = /var/spool/samba
   printable = yes
   guest ok = no
   read only = yes
   create mask = 0700

[print$]
   comment = Printer Drivers
   path = /var/lib/samba/printers
   browseable = yes
   read only = yes
   guest ok = no
```

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`[sharename]`|The name of the network share.|
|`workgroup = WORKGROUP/DOMAIN`|Workgroup that will appear when clients query.|
|`path = /path/here/`|The directory to which user is to be given access.|
|`server string = STRING`|The string that will show up when a connection is initiated.|
|`unix password sync = yes`|Synchronize the UNIX password with the SMB password?|
|`usershare allow guests = yes`|Allow non-authenticated users to access defined share?|
|`map to guest = bad user`|What to do when a user login request doesn't match a valid UNIX user?|
|`browseable = yes`|Should this share be shown in the list of available shares?|
|`guest ok = yes`|Allow connecting to the service without using a password?|
|`read only = yes`|Allow users to read files only?|
|`create mask = 0700`|What permissions need to be set for newly created files?|

## Dangerous Settings
|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`browseable = yes`|Allow listing available shares in the current share?|
|`read only = no`|Forbid the creation and modification of files?|
|`writable = yes`|Allow users to create and modify files?|
|`guest ok = yes`|Allow connecting to the service without using a password?|
|`enable privileges = yes`|Honor privileges assigned to specific SID?|
|`create mask = 0777`|What permissions must be assigned to the newly created files?|
|`directory mask = 0777`|What permissions must be assigned to the newly created directories?|
|`logon script = script.sh`|What script needs to be executed on the user's login?|
|`magic script = script.sh`|Which script should be executed when the script gets closed?|
|`magic output = script.out`|Where the output of the magic script needs to be stored?|
Let us create a share called `[notes]` and a few others and see how the settings affect our enumeration process. We will use all of the above settings and apply them to this share.

#### SMBclient - Connecting to the Share
We use the so-called `null session` (`-N`), which is `anonymous` access without the input of existing users or valid passwords.
Now we can display a list (`-L`) of the server's shares with the `smbclient` command from our host.
```
$ smbclient -N -L //10.129.14.128
```
Once we have discovered interesting files or folders, we can download them using the `get` command. Smbclient also allows us to execute local system commands using an exclamation mark at the beginning (`!<cmd>`) without interrupting the connection.

From the administrative point of view, we can check these connections using `smbstatus`.

## Footprinting the Service
The [Remote Procedure Call](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remote-procedure-call-rpc-in-operating-system/) (`RPC`) is a concept and, therefore, also a central tool to realize operational and work-sharing structures in networks and client-server architectures. The communication process via RPC includes passing parameters and the return of a function value.

#### RPCclient
```
$ rpcclient -U "" 10.129.14.128

Enter WORKGROUP\'s password:
rpcclient $>
```

The `rpcclient` offers us many different requests with which we can execute specific functions on the SMB server to get information. A complete list of all these functions can be found on the [man page](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html) of the rpcclient.

|**Query**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`srvinfo`|Server information.|
|`enumdomains`|Enumerate all domains that are deployed in the network.|
|`querydominfo`|Provides domain, server, and user information of deployed domains.|
|`netshareenumall`|Enumerates all available shares.|
|`netsharegetinfo <share>`|Provides information about a specific share.|
|`enumdomusers`|Enumerates all domain users.|
|`queryuser <RID>`|Provides information about a specific user.|

#### Brute Forcing User RIDs
```
$ for i in $(seq 500 1100);do rpcclient -N -U "" 10.129.14.128 -c "queryuser 0x$(printf '%x\n' $i)" | grep "User Name\|user_rid\|group_rid" && echo "";done
```

An alternative to this would be a Python script from [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) called [samrdump.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/samrdump.py).

```
$ samrdump.py 10.129.14.128
```

The information we have already obtained with `rpcclient` can also be obtained using other tools. For example, the [SMBMap](https://github.com/ShawnDEvans/smbmap) and [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) tools are also widely used and helpful for the enumeration of SMB services.
```
$ smbmap -H 10.129.14.128
```
```
$ crackmapexec smb 10.129.14.128 --shares -u '' -p ''
```
Another tool worth mentioning is the so-called [enum4linux-ng](https://github.com/cddmp/enum4linux-ng), which is based on an older tool, enum4linux. This tool automates many of the queries, but not all, and can return a large amount of information.
```
$ ./enum4linux-ng.py 10.129.14.128 -A
```

# NFS
[NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System) is used between Linux and Unix systems. This means that NFS clients cannot communicate directly with SMB servers. NFS is an Internet standard that governs the procedures in a distributed file system.
 
| **Version** | **Features**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NFSv2`     | It is older but is supported by many systems and was initially operated entirely over UDP.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `NFSv3`     | It has more features, including variable file size and better error reporting, but is not fully compatible with NFSv2 clients.                                                                                                                                       |
| `NFSv4`     | It includes Kerberos, works through firewalls and on the Internet, no longer requires portmappers, supports ACLs, applies state-based operations, and provides performance improvements and high security. It is also the first version to have a stateful protocol. |

NFS is based on the [Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_RPC) (`ONC-RPC`/`SUN-RPC`) protocol exposed on `TCP` and `UDP` ports `111`, which uses [External Data Representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_Data_Representation) (`XDR`) for the system-independent exchange of data. The NFS protocol has `no` mechanism for `authentication` or `authorization`.
The most common authentication is via UNIX `UID`/`GID` and `group memberships`, which is why this syntax is most likely to be applied to the NFS protocol.
## Default Configuration
The `/etc/exports` file contains a table of physical filesystems on an NFS server accessible by the clients. The [NFS Exports Table](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man5/exports.5.html) shows which options it accepts and thus indicates which options are available to us.
```
$ cat /etc/exports 

# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
```
The default `exports` file also contains some examples of configuring NFS shares. First, the folder is specified and made available to others, and then the rights they will have on this NFS share are connected to a host or a subnet. Finally, additional options can be added to the hosts or subnets.

| **Option**         | **Description**                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rw`               | Read and write permissions.                                                                                                                 |
| `ro`               | Read only permissions.                                                                                                                      |
| `sync`             | Synchronous data transfer. (A bit slower)                                                                                                   |
| `async`            | Asynchronous data transfer. (A bit faster)                                                                                                  |
| `secure`           | Ports above 1024 will not be used.                                                                                                          |
| `insecure`         | Ports above 1024 will be used.                                                                                                              |
| `no_subtree_check` | This option disables the checking of subdirectory trees.                                                                                    |
| `root_squash`      | Assigns all permissions to files of root UID/GID 0 to the UID/GID of anonymous, which prevents `root` from accessing files on an NFS mount. |
#### ExportFS

```
root@nfs:~# echo '/mnt/nfs  10.129.14.0/24(sync,no_subtree_check)' >> /etc/exports root@nfs:~# systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server  root@nfs:~# exportfs /mnt/nfs        10.129.14.0/24
```
## Dangerous Settings

However, even with NFS, some settings can be dangerous for the company and its infrastructure. Here are some of them listed:

| **Option**       | **Description**                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rw`             | Read and write permissions.                                                                                          |
| `insecure`       | Ports above 1024 will be used.                                                                                       |
| `nohide`         | If another file system was mounted below an exported directory, this directory is exported by its own exports entry. |
| `no_root_squash` | All files created by root are kept with the UID/GID 0.                                                               |
## Footprinting the Service

When footprinting NFS, the TCP ports `111` and `2049` are essential. We can also get information about the NFS service and the host via RPC.
#### Show Available NFS Shares

```
$ showmount -e 10.129.14.128 
cExport list for 10.129.14.128: /mnt/nfs 10.129.14.0/24
```
#### Mounting NFS Share

```
$ mkdir target-NFS
$ sudo mount -t nfs 10.129.14.128:/ ./target-NFS/ -o nolock 
$ cd target-NFS
$ tree . 
. 
└── mnt
    └── nfs
    ├── id_rsa   
	├── id_rsa.pub        
	└── nfs.share
2 directories, 3 files
```
#### List Contents with Usernames & Group Names
```
$ ls -l mnt/nfs/
```
#### List Contents with UIDs & GUIDs
```
$ ls -n mnt/nfs/
```
It is important to note that if the `root_squash` option is set, we cannot edit the `backup.sh` file even as `root`.
#### Unmounting
```
$ cd ..
$ sudo umount ./target-NFS
```

# DNS
|**Server Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`DNS Root Server`|The root servers of the DNS are responsible for the top-level domains (`TLD`). As the last instance, they are only requested if the name server does not respond. Thus, a root server is a central interface between users and content on the Internet, as it links domain and IP address. The [Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers](https://www.icann.org/) (`ICANN`) coordinates the work of the root name servers. There are `13` such root servers around the globe.|
|`Authoritative Nameserver`|Authoritative name servers hold authority for a particular zone. They only answer queries from their area of responsibility, and their information is binding. If an authoritative name server cannot answer a client's query, the root name server takes over at that point. Based on the country, company, etc., authoritative nameservers provide answers to recursive DNS nameservers, assisting in finding the specific web server(s).|
|`Non-authoritative Nameserver`|Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for a particular DNS zone. Instead, they collect information on specific DNS zones themselves, which is done using recursive or iterative DNS querying.|
|`Caching DNS Server`|Caching DNS servers cache information from other name servers for a specified period. The authoritative name server determines the duration of this storage.|
|`Forwarding Server`|Forwarding servers perform only one function: they forward DNS queries to another DNS server.|
|`Resolver`|Resolvers are not authoritative DNS servers but perform name resolution locally in the computer or router.|
## Default Configuration
All DNS servers work with three different types of configuration files:

    local DNS configuration files
    zone files
    reverse name resolution files

The DNS server Bind9 is very often used on Linux-based distributions. Its local configuration file (named.conf) is roughly divided into two sections, firstly the options section for general settings and secondly the zone entries for the individual domains. The local configuration files are usually:

    named.conf.local
    named.conf.options
    named.conf.log
The configuration file named.conf is divided into several options that control the behavior of the name server. A distinction is made between global options and zone options.
## Local DNS Configuration
``` 
# cat /etc/bind/named.conf.local

A zone file is a text file that describes a DNS zone with the BIND file format. In other words it is a point of delegation in the DNS tree. The BIND file format is the industry-preferred zone file format and is now well established in DNS server software. A zone file describes a zone completely. There must be precisely one SOA record and at least one NS record. The SOA resource record is usually located at the beginning of a zone file. The main goal of these global rules is to improve the readability of zone files. A syntax error usually results in the entire zone file being considered unusable. The name server behaves similarly as if this zone did not exist. It responds to DNS queries with a SERVFAIL error message.
#### Zone Files
```
# cat /etc/bind/db.domain.com

;
; BIND reverse data file for local loopback interface
;
$ORIGIN domain.com
$TTL 86400
@     IN     SOA    dns1.domain.com.     hostmaster.domain.com. (

                    3600       ; retry after 1 hour
                    604800     ; expire after 1 week

### Dangerous Settings
There are many ways in which a DNS server can be attacked. For example, a list of vulnerabilities targeting the BIND9 server can be found at [CVEdetails](https://www.cvedetails.com/product/144/ISC-Bind.html?vendor_id=64). In addition, SecurityTrails provides a short [list](https://web.archive.org/web/20250329174745/https://securitytrails.com/blog/most-popular-types-dns-attacks) of the most popular attacks on DNS servers.

|**Option**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`allow-query`|Defines which hosts are allowed to send requests to the DNS server.|
|`allow-recursion`|Defines which hosts are allowed to send recursive requests to the DNS server.|
|`allow-transfer`|Defines which hosts are allowed to receive zone transfers from the DNS server.|
|`zone-statistics`|Collects statistical data of zones.|
## Footprinting the Service
#### DIG - NS Query
```
$ dig ns inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128
```
Sometimes it is also possible to query a DNS server's version using a class CHAOS query and type TXT.
#### DIG - Version Query
```
$ dig CH TXT version.bind 10.129.120.85
```

We can use the option `ANY` to view all available records. This will cause the server to show us all available entries that it is willing to disclose.
#### DIG - ANY Query
```
$ dig any inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128
```

`Zone transfer` refers to the transfer of zones to another server in DNS, which generally happens over TCP port 53. This procedure is abbreviated `Asynchronous Full Transfer Zone` (`AXFR`). Since a DNS failure usually has severe consequences for a company, the zone file is almost invariably kept identical on several name servers. When changes are made, it must be ensured that all servers have the same data. Synchronization between the servers involved is realized by zone transfer.
#### DIG - AXFR Zone Transfer
```
$ dig axfr inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128
```
If the administrator used a subnet for the `allow-transfer` option for testing purposes or as a workaround solution or set it to `any`, everyone would query the entire zone file at the DNS server.
#### DIG - AXFR Zone Transfer - Internal
```
$ dig axfr internal.inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128
```
The individual `A` records with the hostnames can also be found out with the help of a brute-force attack. To do this, we need a list of possible hostnames, which we use to send the requests in order. Such lists are provided, for example, by [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt).

An option would be to execute a `for-loop` in Bash that lists these entries and sends the corresponding query to the desired DNS server.
#### Subdomain Brute Forcing
```
$ for sub in $(cat /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt);do dig $sub.inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128 | grep -v ';\|SOA' | sed -r '/^\s*$/d' | grep $sub | tee -a subdomains.txt;done
```

Many different tools can be used for this, and most of them work in the same way. One of these tools is, for example [DNSenum](https://github.com/fwaeytens/dnsenum).

# SMTP
By default, SMTP servers accept connection requests on port `25`. However, newer SMTP servers also use other ports such as TCP port `587`. This port is used to receive mail from authenticated users/servers, usually using the STARTTLS command to switch the existing plaintext connection to an encrypted connection.
An essential function of an SMTP server is preventing spam using authentication mechanisms that allow only authorized users to send e-mails.
1. Client (`MUA`)
2. Submission Agent (`MSA`)
3. Open Relay (`MTA`)
4. Mail Delivery Agent (`MDA`)
5. Mailbox (`POP3`/`IMAP`)

SMTP has two disadvantages inherent to the network protocol.

1. The first is that sending an email using SMTP does not return a usable delivery confirmation. Although the specifications of the protocol provide for this type of notification, its formatting is not specified by default, so that usually only an English-language error message, including the header of the undelivered message, is returned.
2. Users are not authenticated when a connection is established, and the sender of an email is therefore unreliable. As a result, open SMTP relays are often misused to send spam en masse. The originators use arbitrary fake sender addresses for this purpose to not be traced (mail spoofing). Today, many different security techniques are used to prevent the misuse of SMTP servers. For example, suspicious emails are rejected or moved to quarantine (spam folder). For example, responsible for this are the identification protocol [DomainKeys](http://dkim.org/) (`DKIM`), the [Sender Policy Framework](https://dmarcian.com/what-is-spf/) (`SPF`).
## Default Configuration
```
$ cat /etc/postfix/main.cf | grep -v "#" | sed -r "/^\s*$/d"

smtpd_banner = ESMTP Server 
biff = no
append_dot_mydomain = no
readme_directory = no
compatibility_level = 2
smtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtp_scache
myhostname = mail1.inlanefreight.htb
alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases
alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases
smtp_generic_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/generic
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost 
masquerade_domains = $myhostname
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 10.129.0.0/16
mailbox_size_limit = 0
recipient_delimiter = +
smtp_bind_address = 0.0.0.0
inet_protocols = ipv4
smtpd_helo_restrictions = reject_invalid_hostname
home_mailbox = /home/postfix
```
The sending and communication are also done by special commands that cause the SMTP server to do what the user requires.

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`AUTH PLAIN`|AUTH is a service extension used to authenticate the client.|
|`HELO`|The client logs in with its computer name and thus starts the session.|
|`MAIL FROM`|The client names the email sender.|
|`RCPT TO`|The client names the email recipient.|
|`DATA`|The client initiates the transmission of the email.|
|`RSET`|The client aborts the initiated transmission but keeps the connection between client and server.|
|`VRFY`|The client checks if a mailbox is available for message transfer.|
|`EXPN`|The client also checks if a mailbox is available for messaging with this command.|
|`NOOP`|The client requests a response from the server to prevent disconnection due to time-out.|
|`QUIT`|The client terminates the session.|
To interact with the SMTP server, we can use the `telnet` tool to initialize a TCP connection with the SMTP server. The actual initialization of the session is done with the command mentioned above, `HELO` or `EHLO`.
The command `VRFY` can be used to enumerate existing users on the system. However, this does not always work. A list of all SMTP response codes can be found [here](https://serversmtp.com/smtp-error/).

Sometimes we may have to work through a web proxy. We can also make this web proxy connect to the SMTP server. The command that we would send would then look something like this: `CONNECT 10.129.14.128:25 HTTP/1.0`

## Dangerous Settings

To prevent the sent emails from being filtered by spam filters and not reaching the recipient, the sender can use a relay server that the recipient trusts. It is an SMTP server that is known and verified by all others. As a rule, the sender must authenticate himself to the relay server before using it.

Often, administrators have no overview of which IP ranges they have to allow. This results in a misconfiguration of the SMTP server that we will still often find in external and internal penetration tests. Therefore, they allow all IP addresses not to cause errors in the email traffic and thus not to disturb or unintentionally interrupt the communication with potential and current customers.

#### Open Relay Configuration
```
mynetworks = 0.0.0.0/0
``` 
With this setting, this SMTP server can send fake emails and thus initialize communication between multiple parties. Another attack possibility would be to spoof the email and read it.

## Footprinting the Service

The default Nmap scripts include `smtp-commands`, which uses the `EHLO` command to list all possible commands that can be executed on the target SMTP server.
However, we can also use the [smtp-open-relay](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smtp-open-relay.html) NSE script to identify the target SMTP server as an open relay using 16 different tests. If we also print out the output of the scan in detail, we will also be able to see which tests the script is running.
# IMAP/POP3
With the help of the `Internet Message Access Protocol` (`IMAP`), access to emails from a mail server is possible. Unlike the `Post Office Protocol` (`POP3`), IMAP allows online management of emails directly on the server and supports folder structures. Thus, it is a network protocol for the online management of emails on a remote server.
IMAP works unencrypted and transmits commands, emails, or usernames and passwords in plain text. Many email servers require establishing an encrypted IMAP session to ensure greater security in email traffic and prevent unauthorized access to mailboxes. SSL/TLS is usually used for this purpose. Depending on the method and implementation used, the encrypted connection uses the standard port `143` or an alternative port such as `993`.
## Default Configuration

Both IMAP and POP3 have a large number of configuration options, making it difficult to deep dive into each component in more detail. If you wish to examine these protocol configurations deeper, we recommend creating a VM locally and install the two packages `dovecot-imapd`, and `dovecot-pop3d` using `apt` and play around with the configurations and experiment.

In the documentation of Dovecot, we can find the individual [core settings](https://doc.dovecot.org/2.4.1/core/summaries/settings.html) and [service configuration](https://doc.dovecot.org/2.4.1/core/config/service.html) options that can be utilized for our experiments.
#### IMAP Commands

| **Command**                                   | **Description**                                                                                               |

| `1 CLOSE`                                     | Removes all messages with the `Deleted` flag set.                                                             |
| `1 LOGOUT`                                    | Closes the connection with the IMAP server.                                                                   |
| `1 UID FETCH 1 (UID RFC822.SIZE BODY.PEEK[])` | See body of message.                                                                                          |

|`CAPA`|Requests the server to display the server capabilities.|
|`RSET`|Requests the server to reset the transmitted information.|
|`QUIT`|Closes the connection with the POP3 server.|
## Dangerous Settings
|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`auth_debug`|Enables all authentication debug logging.|
|`auth_debug_passwords`|This setting adjusts log verbosity, the submitted passwords, and the scheme gets logged.|
|`auth_verbose`|Logs unsuccessful authentication attempts and their reasons.|
|`auth_verbose_passwords`|Passwords used for authentication are logged and can also be truncated.|
|`auth_anonymous_username`|This specifies the username to be used when logging in with the ANONYMOUS SASL mechanism.|
## Footprinting the Service
By default, ports `110` and `995` are used for POP3, and ports `143` and `993` are used for IMAP. The higher ports (`993` and `995`) use TLS/SSL to encrypt the communication between the client and server.
#### cURL
```
$ curl -k 'imaps://10.129.14.128' --user user:p4ssw0rd
```
If we also use the `verbose` (`-v`) option, we will see how the connection is made. From this, we can see the version of TLS used for encryption, further details of the SSL certificate, and even the banner, which will often contain the version of the mail server.

To interact with the IMAP or POP3 server over SSL, we can use `openssl`, as well as `ncat`. The commands for this would look like this:
#### OpenSSL - TLS Encrypted Interaction POP3
```
$ openssl s_client -connect 10.129.14.128:pop3s
```
#### OpenSSL - TLS Encrypted Interaction IMAP
```
$ openssl s_client -connect 10.129.14.128:imaps
```

# SNMP
`Simple Network Management Protocol` ([SNMP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1157)) was created to monitor network devices. In addition, this protocol can also be used to handle configuration tasks and change settings remotely.
SNMP also transmits control commands using agents over UDP port `161`. The client can set specific values in the device and change options and settings with these commands. While in classical communication, it is always the client who actively requests information from the server, SNMP also enables the use of so-called `traps` over UDP port `162`.
#### MIB
To ensure that SNMP access works across manufacturers and with different client-server combinations, the `Management Information Base` (`MIB`) was created.

#### OID
An OID represents a node in a hierarchical namespace. A sequence of numbers uniquely identifies each node, allowing the node's position in the tree to be determined.

## Default Configuration
```
$ cat /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'

sysLocation    Sitting on the Dock of the Bay
sysContact     Me <me@example.org>
sysServices    72
master  agentx
agentaddress  127.0.0.1,[::1]
view   systemonly  included   .1.3.6.1.2.1.1
view   systemonly  included   .1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1
rocommunity  public default -V systemonly
rocommunity6 public default -V systemonly
rouser authPrivUser authpriv -V systemonly
```
## Dangerous Settings

Some dangerous settings that the administrator can make with SNMP are:

|**Settings**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`rwuser noauth`|Provides access to the full OID tree without authentication.|
|`rwcommunity <community string> <IPv4 address>`|Provides access to the full OID tree regardless of where the requests were sent from.|
|`rwcommunity6 <community string> <IPv6 address>`|Same access as with `rwcommunity` with the difference of using IPv6.|
## Footprinting the Service

For footprinting SNMP, we can use tools like `snmpwalk`, `onesixtyone`, and `braa`. `Snmpwalk` is used to query the OIDs with their information. `Onesixtyone` can be used to brute-force the names of the community strings since they can be named arbitrarily by the administrator. Since these community strings can be bound to any source, identifying the existing community strings can take quite some time.
```
$ snmpwalk -v2c -c public 10.129.14.128
```
```
$ onesixtyone -c /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/SNMP/snmp.txt 10.129.14.128
```
Once we know a community string, we can use it with [braa](https://github.com/mteg/braa) to brute-force the individual OIDs and enumerate the information behind them.
#### Braa
```
$ braa <community string>@<IP>:.1.3.6.*   # Syntax
```

# MYSQL
MySQL is an open-source SQL relational database management system developed and supported by Oracle.
## MySQL Clients
The MySQL clients can retrieve and edit the data using structured queries to the database engine. 
#### MySQL Databases
In a web hosting with MySQL database, this serves as a central instance in which content required by PHP scripts is stored. Among these are:

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Headers|Texts|Meta tags|Forms|
|Customers|Usernames|Administrators|Moderators|
|Email addresses|User information|Permissions|Passwords|
|External/Internal links|Links to Files|Specific contents|Values|
Sensitive data such as passwords can be stored in their plain-text form by MySQL; however, they are generally encrypted beforehand by the PHP scripts using secure methods such as [One-Way-Encryption](https://en.citizendium.org/wiki/One-way_encryption).

## Default Configuration
```
$ cat /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'

[client]
port        = 3306
socket      = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

[mysqld_safe]

socket      = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
nice        = 0

[mysqld]

tmpdir      = /tmp
lc-messages-dir = /usr/share/mysql
explicit_defaults_for_timestamp

symbolic-links=0

!includedir /etc/mysql/conf.d/
```
## Dangerous Settings
|**Settings**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`user`|Sets which user the MySQL service will run as.|
|`password`|Sets the password for the MySQL user.|
|`admin_address`|The IP address on which to listen for TCP/IP connections on the administrative network interface.|
|`debug`|This variable indicates the current debugging settings|
|`sql_warnings`|This variable controls whether single-row INSERT statements produce an information string if warnings occur.|
|`secure_file_priv`|This variable is used to limit the effect of data import and export operations.|
## Footprinting the Service
Usually, the MySQL server runs on `TCP port 3306`, and we can scan this port with `Nmap` to get more detailed information.

#### Scanning MySQL Server
```
$ sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sV -sC -p3306 --script mysql*
```
#### Interaction with the MySQL Server
```
$ mysql -u root -h 10.129.14.132
```

```
$ mysql -u root -pP4SSw0rd -h 10.129.14.128
```

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`mysql -u <user> -p<password> -h <IP address>`|Connect to the MySQL server. There should **not** be a space between the '-p' flag, and the password.|
|`show databases;`|Show all databases.|
|`use <database>;`|Select one of the existing databases.|
|`show tables;`|Show all available tables in the selected database.|
|`show columns from <table>;`|Show all columns in the selected table.|
|`select * from <table>;`|Show everything in the desired table.|
|`select * from <table> where <column> = "<string>";`|Search for needed `string` in the desired table.|
# MSSQL
#### MSSQL Clients

[SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15) (`SSMS`) comes as a feature that can be installed with the MSSQL install package or can be downloaded & installed separately.
Many other clients can be used to access a database running on MSSQL. Including but not limited to:
|[mssql-cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/mssql-cli?view=sql-server-ver15)|[SQL Server PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/powershell/sql-server-powershell?view=sql-server-ver15)|[HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com)|[SQLPro](https://www.macsqlclient.com)|[Impacket's mssqlclient.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/mssqlclient.py)|

#### MSSQL Databases

MSSQL has default system databases that can help us understand the structure of all the databases that may be hosted on a target server. Here are the default databases and a brief description of each:

|Default System Database|Description|
|---|---|
|`master`|Tracks all system information for an SQL server instance|
|`model`|Template database that acts as a structure for every new database created. Any setting changed in the model database will be reflected in any new database created after changes to the model database|
|`msdb`|The SQL Server Agent uses this database to schedule jobs & alerts|
|`tempdb`|Stores temporary objects|
|`resource`|Read-only database containing system objects included with SQL server|
## Dangerous Settings
We may benefit from looking into the following:

- MSSQL clients not using encryption to connect to the MSSQL server
- The use of self-signed certificates when encryption is being used. It is possible to spoof self-signed certificates
- The use of [named pipes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/configuration-manager/named-pipes-properties?view=sql-server-ver15)
- Weak & default `sa` credentials. Admins may forget to disable this account
## Footprinting the Service

There are many ways we can approach footprinting the MSSQL service, the more specific we can get with our scans, the more useful information we will be able to gather. NMAP has default mssql scripts that can be used to target the default tcp port `1433` that MSSQL listens on.
```
$ sudo nmap --script ms-sql-info,ms-sql-empty-password,ms-sql-xp-cmdshell,ms-sql-config,ms-sql-ntlm-info,ms-sql-tables,ms-sql-hasdbaccess,ms-sql-dac,ms-sql-dump-hashes --script-args mssql.instance-port=1433,mssql.username=sa,mssql.password=,mssql.instance-name=MSSQLSERVER -sV -p 1433 10.129.201.248
```
We can also use Metasploit to run an auxiliary scanner called `mssql_ping` that will scan the MSSQL service and provide helpful information in our footprinting process.

#### Connecting with Mssqlclient.py
If we can guess or gain access to credentials, this allows us to remotely connect to the MSSQL server and start interacting with databases using T-SQL (`Transact-SQL`).
```
$ python3 mssqlclient.py Administrator@10.129.201.248 -windows-auth
```

# Oracle TNS
The `Oracle Transparent Network Substrate` (`TNS`) server is a communication protocol that facilitates communication between Oracle databases and applications over networks. Initially introduced as part of the [Oracle Net Services](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/netag/introducing-oracle-net-services.html) software suite, TNS supports various networking protocols between Oracle databases and client applications, such as `IPX/SPX` and `TCP/IP` protocol stacks

## Default Configuration
The default configuration of the Oracle TNS server varies depending on the version and edition of Oracle software installed. However, some common settings are usually configured by default in Oracle TNS. By default, the listener listens for incoming connections on the `TCP/1521` port. However, this default port can be changed during installation or later in the configuration file. The TNS listener is configured to support various network protocols, including `TCP/IP`, `UDP`, `IPX/SPX`, and `AppleTalk`. The listener can also support multiple network interfaces and listen on specific IP addresses or all available network interfaces. By default, Oracle TNS can be remotely managed in `Oracle 8i`/`9i` but not in Oracle 10g/11g.
Oracle TNS is often used with other Oracle services like Oracle DBSNMP, Oracle Databases, Oracle Application Server, Oracle Enterprise Manager, Oracle Fusion Middleware, web servers, and many more. There have been made many changes for the default installation of Oracle services. For example, Oracle 9 has a default password, `CHANGE_ON_INSTALL`, whereas Oracle 10 has no default password set. The Oracle DBSNMP service also uses a default password, `dbsnmp` that we should remember when we come across this one. Another example would be that many organizations still use the `finger` service together with Oracle, which can put Oracle's service at risk and make it vulnerable when we have the required knowledge of a home directory.
Each database or service has a unique entry in the [tnsnames.ora](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/network.112/e10835/tnsnames.htm#NETRF007) file, containing the necessary information for clients to connect to the service. The entry consists of a name for the service, the network location of the service, and the database or service name that clients should use when connecting to the service. For example, a simple `tnsnames.ora` file might look like this:
```txt
ORCL =
   (DESCRIPTION =
       (ADDRESS_LIST =
             (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 10.129.11.102)(PORT = 1521))    
        )    
        (CONNECT_DATA =
              (SERVER = DEDICATED)
	          (SERVICE_NAME = orcl)
	    )  
	)
```
On the other hand, the `listener.ora` file is a server-side configuration file that defines the listener process's properties and parameters, which is responsible for receiving incoming client requests and forwarding them to the appropriate Oracle database instance.
```
SID_LIST_LISTENER =
  (SID_LIST =
    (SID_DESC =
      (SID_NAME = PDB1)
      (ORACLE_HOME = C:\oracle\product\19.0.0\dbhome_1)
      (GLOBAL_DBNAME = PDB1)
      (SID_DIRECTORY_LIST =
        (SID_DIRECTORY =
          (DIRECTORY_TYPE = TNS_ADMIN)
          (DIRECTORY = C:\oracle\product\19.0.0\dbhome_1\network\admin)
        )
      )
    )
  )

LISTENER =
  (DESCRIPTION_LIST =
    (DESCRIPTION =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = orcl.inlanefreight.htb)(PORT = 1521))
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = IPC)(KEY = EXTPROC1521))
    )
  )

ADR_BASE_LISTENER = C:\oracle
```
Oracle databases can be protected by using so-called PL/SQL Exclusion List (`PlsqlExclusionList`). It is a user-created text file that needs to be placed in the `$ORACLE_HOME/sqldeveloper` directory, and it contains the names of PL/SQL packages or types that should be excluded from execution. Once the PL/SQL Exclusion List file is created, it can be loaded into the database instance. It serves as a blacklist that cannot be accessed through the Oracle Application Server.

# IPMI
[Intelligent Platform Management Interface](https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/IPMI_Basics) (IPMI) is a set of standardized specifications for hardware-based host management systems used for system management and monitoring. It acts as an autonomous subsystem and works independently of the host's BIOS, CPU, firmware, and underlying operating system. IPMI provides sysadmins with the ability to manage and monitor systems even if they are powered off or in an unresponsive state. It operates using a direct network connection to the system's hardware and does not require access to the operating system via a login shell. IPMI can also be used for remote upgrades to systems without requiring physical access to the target host. IPMI is typically used in three ways:

    Before the OS has booted to modify BIOS settings
    When the host is fully powered down
    Access to a host after a system failure
When not being used for these tasks, IPMI can monitor a range of different things such as system temperature, voltage, fan status, and power supplies. It can also be used for querying inventory information, reviewing hardware logs, and alerting using SNMP. The host system can be powered off, but the IPMI module requires a power source and a LAN connection to work correctly.
## Footprinting the Service

IPMI communicates over port 623 UDP. Systems that use the IPMI protocol are called Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs). BMCs are typically implemented as embedded ARM systems running Linux, and connected directly to the host's motherboard.
#### Nmap
```
$ sudo nmap -sU --script ipmi-version -p 623 ilo.inlanfreight.local
```
#### Metasploit Version Scan
```
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version 
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version) > set rhosts 10.129.42.195
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version) > show options 
```
## Dangerous Settings
If default credentials do not work to access a BMC, we can turn to a [flaw](http://fish2.com/ipmi/remote-pw-cracking.html) in the RAKP protocol in IPMI 2.0. During the authentication process, the server sends a salted SHA1 or MD5 hash of the user's password to the client before authentication takes place. This can be leveraged to obtain the password hash for ANY valid user account on the BMC. These password hashes can then be cracked offline using a dictionary attack using `Hashcat` mode `7300`. In the event of an HP iLO using a factory default password, we can use this Hashcat mask attack command `hashcat -m 7300 ipmi.txt -a 3 ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1 -1 ?d?u` which tries all combinations of upper case letters and numbers for an eight-character password.
To retrieve IPMI hashes, we can use the Metasploit [IPMI 2.0 RAKP Remote SHA1 Password Hash Retrieval](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/scanner/ipmi/ipmi_dumphashes/) module.
