 A system almost always have more tasks to execute then processing units available. 
 Different tasks have different needs, and not always we have the necessary processing power, so, we have to develop strategies to manage the needs of each task.
## Concept of Task
A task is defined as being a execution of a sequencing flux of instructions, built to attend a specific duty.
It's important to highlight the difference between tasks and programs:
- Program: Is a set of one or more sequences of instructions written to resolve a specific problem. The program represent a static concept, without a internal state defined and without interaction with other entities. notepad.exe and vi are an example of programs.
- Task: Is a sequential execution, by a processor, of a sequence of instructions defined in a program to perform it's objective.  It's a dynamic concept, that has a well defined internal state at each instant and interact with others entities: the user, peripherals, other tasks.
Making a simple analogy, we can say that a program is "cake recipe" inside a recipe book (a directory), in a book stand  (disk) in a kitchen (computer). This recipe defines the ingredients (ins) and the preparation (program) of the cake (outs). The "execution" of the recipe, is the task.
