BrIm is an open-source desktop application that processes pcap files and log files. Its primary focus is providing search and analytics.
It uses Zeek log processing format. It also supports Zeek signatures and Suricata Rules for detection.

It can handle two types of data as an input;

- Packet Capture Files: Pcap files created with tcpdump, tshark and Wireshark like applications.
- Log Files: Structured log files like Zeek logs.
Brim is built on opne-source platforms:
- Zeek: Log generating engine
- Zed Language: Log querying language that allows performing keyword searches with filters and pipelines
- ZNG Data Format: Data storage format that supports saving data streams.
- Electron and React: Cross-platform UI.

**Landing Page**  

Once you open the application, the landing page loads up. The landing page has three sections and a file importing window. It also provides quick info on supported file formats.

- **Pools:** Data resources, investigated pcap and log files.
- **Queries:** List of available queries.
- **History:** List of launched queries.

**Default Queries**

Brim provides pre-made queries, here are some:

Activity Overview: ```count() by _path | sort -r```

Windows Specific Networking Activity : ```_path matcher smb* OR _path=="dce_rpc" | sort -r _path```
