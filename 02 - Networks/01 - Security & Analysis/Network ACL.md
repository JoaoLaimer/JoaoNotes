Access Control List (ACL) is a series of commands that control whether a device forwards or drops packets based on information found in the packet header. When configured, ACLs perform the following tasks:
- They limit network traffic to increase network performance.
- They provide traffic flow control. ACLS can restrict the delivery of routing updates to ensure that the updates are from a known source.
- They provide a basic level of security for network access.
- They filter traffic based on traffic type.
- They screen hosts to permit or deny access to network service.
