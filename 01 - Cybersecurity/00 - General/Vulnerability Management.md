 Vulnerability management is an ongoing, proactive, and frequently automated activity that protects computer systems, networks, and enterprise solutions from cyberattacks and data breaches. Consequently, it is a vital component of an overall security program. By discovering, evaluating, and correcting potential security flaws, businesses can help avoid attacks and mitigate their effects if they occur.
 > Environmental variables refer to the unique characteristics of an organization's infrastructure, business environment, and operational context that can impact vulnerability management and risk analysis.

## Vulnerability Classification
The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) standard components are as follows:
- **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE):** [MITRE](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/) maintains the CVE list of publicly documented vulnerabilities and exposures. Each of the CVEs identifies a vulnerability that may be exploited to launch an attack. With a unique identifier, a description, and at least one public reference, CVE seeks to standardise the identification of security vulnerabilities. Anyone can access the CVE system at no cost, making it a valuable resource for security management professionals and organizations. [CVE Details](https://www.cvedetails.com/) is also a renowned website for searching CVEs and their impact.
-  **Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE):** A CCE gives system configuration issues unique identifiers to quickly and accurately link configuration data from different information sources and tools. For instance, CCE identifiers can be used to match up configuration assessment tool results with recommended best practices. This is comparable to the CVE list, which gives publicly reported system vulnerability IDs.
- **Common Platform Enumeration (CPE):** CPE is a method for classifying and identifying devices, operating systems (OS), and application types inside an infrastructure. CPE is widely used in security and vulnerability management tools to identify various assets and to take accurate automated decisions through correlation with CVE and CCE.
- **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):** CVSS is a scoring system that rates the severity of vulnerabilities and identifies their characteristics. It assigns severity scores to all defined vulnerabilities, which is used to prioritise mitigation efforts and the required resources based on the severity. The range of possible scores is 0 to 10, with 10 representing the most severe.

## Vulnerability Management Lifecycle
There are six essential phases in the vulnerability management lifecycle that can be mapped out from the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework); each includes its sub-processes and activities. These stages can be used by organisations wishing to develop or enhance their vulnerability management program.
#### Step 1: Discover
The first step is to compile a list of all the environment's resources/assets, including the applications, services, operating systems, and configurations, to identify vulnerabilities. Typically, this combines both a network scan and a system scan and enables you against any potential threat to the organisation's information and critical infrastructure. For this purpose, organisation-wide scanning should be planned and conducted regularly.
#### Step 2: Prioritise  
The second step involves grouping and assigning a risk-based priority to the assets (identified during the discovery phase) based on how crucial they are to the business. This can significantly assist the organisation in determining which groups require special attention and thus will aid in the decision-making process when distributing resources.
#### Step 3: Assess
The third phase involves creating a risk baseline by evaluating your assets to determine how severe each is. The process lets organisations decide which risks to eliminate based on factors such as their classification, criticality level, and vulnerability level. In the longer run, assessments help organisations establish a consistent baseline.

#### Step 4: Reporting
The next step is to use the assessment results to determine the risk levels associated with each vulnerability. **Documenting and reporting** known vulnerabilities is crucial. It makes it easier for security engineers to monitor vulnerability dynamics throughout their networks and guarantees that businesses continue to adhere to all applicable security requirements and regulations.

#### Step 5: Remediation
This phase involves fixing the vulnerabilities discovered earlier, beginning with the most severe ones. The identified vulnerabilities should be reported to the concerned stakeholders for remediation. A few approaches are available to organisations for dealing with known vulnerabilities and configuration errors. **Remedial action, such as thoroughly addressing or patching vulnerabilities, is the best course of action**. If complete remediation is not feasible, businesses might mitigate, which entails lowering the risk of exploitation or minimising the potential harm. Finally, security engineers can acknowledge their vulnerability, for instance, when the risk involved is low, and choose to do nothing.

#### Step 6: Verification & Monitoring
In the last step of vulnerability management, regular audits and process monitoring are used to guarantee that all threats have been eradicated. 

The [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/) created the [Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) as a guidance for organisations to better manage and reduce their cybersecurity risks. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is intended as a comprehensive cyber strategy and has become a helpful risk management resource for corporate sector businesses and government entities. The fundamental components of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework are broken down into five areas applicable to vulnerability management that help to achieve the cybersecurity objectives of an organisation.

- **Identify**: What assets and processes require security?  

- **Protect:** Put the right security measures in place to protect the organisation's assets.
- **Detect:** Implement adequate procedures to detect cybersecurity events.
- **Respond**: Develop methods for mitigating the effects of cybersecurity incidents.
- **Recover**: Implement the proper procedures for restoring capabilities and services impacted by cybersecurity incidents.
