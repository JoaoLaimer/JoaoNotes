Threat modelling is a systematic approach to identifying, prioritizing, and addressing potential security threats across the organization. By simulating possible attack scenarios and assessing the existing vulnerabilities of the organisation's interconnected systems and applications, threat modelling enables organisations to develop proactive security measures and make informed decision about resource allocation.  
Threat modelling aims to reduce an organisation's overall risk exposure by identifying vulnerabilities and potential attack vector, allowing for adequate security controls and strategies.

## Threat, Vulnerability and Risk
- **Threat**: Refers to any potential occurrence, event, or actor that may exploit vulnerabilities to compromise information confidentiality, integrity, or availability. It may come in various forms, such as cyber attacks, human error, or natural disasters.
	- Occurrence of someone breaking inside your home and taking all your belongings.
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness or flaw in a system, application, or process that may be exploited by a threat to cause harm. It may arise from software bugs, misconfiguration, or design flaws.
	- Weakness in your home security, such as broken locks or open windows.
 - **Risk**: The possibility of being compromised because of a threat taking advantage of a vulnerability. A way to think about how likely an attack might be successful and how much damage it could cause.
	 - Likelihood of being burglarize due to living in a neighborhood with a high crime rate or a lack of an alarm system.

## High-Level Process of Threat Modelling
1. **Defining the Scope**: Identify the specific system, applications, and networks in the threat modelling exercise.
2. **Asset Identification**: Develop diagrams of the organisation's architecture and its dependencies. It is also essential to identify the importance of each asset.
3. **Identify Threats**: Identify potential threats that may impact the identified assets.
4. **Analyse Vulnerabilities and Priorities Risks**: Based on the potential impact of identified threats.
5. **Develop and Implement Countermeasures**: Security controls to address the identified risks.
6. **Monitor and Evaluate**: Continuously test and monitor the effectiveness of the implemented countermeasures.

## Different Teams and Their Role in Threat Modelling
- **Security Team**: The overarching team of red and blue teams. This team typically lead the threat modelling process, providing expertise on threats, vulnerabilities, and risk mitigation strategies. They also ensure security measures are implemented, validated, and continuously monitored.
- **Development Team**: Responsible for building secure systems and applications. Their involvement ensures that security is always incorporated throughout the development life-cycle.
- **IT and Operations Team**: Manages the infrastructure including networks, servers, and other critical systems. Their knowledge of network infrastructure, system configurations and application integrations is essential for effective threat modelling.
- **Governance, Risk and Compliance Team**: The GRC team is responsible for organisation-wide compliance assessments based on industry regulations and internal policies. They collaborate with the security team to align threat modelling with the organisation's risk management objectives.
- **Business Stakeholders**: They provide valuable input on the organisation's critical assets, business processes, and risk tolerance. Their involvement ensures that the efforts align with the organisation's strategic goals.
- **End Users**: Can provide unique insights and perspectives that other teams may not have, enabling the identification of vulnerabilities and risks specific to user interactions and behaviors.
## Attack Tree
An graphical representation used in threat modelling. It provides a structured, hierarchical approach to breaking down attack scenarios into smaller components. Each node in the tree represents a specific event or condition, with the root node representing the attackers primary goal.
