The pyramid of pain represents the amount of pain caused when detecting a part of a campaign to an adversary.

Hash Values (Trivial)
	- MD5 (Message Digest, RFC 1321, Ron Rivest) - 128-bit hash, not considered secure.
	- SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1, RFC 3174, NSA) - 160-bit hash, deprecated in 2011.
	- SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2, NIST) - SHA-256, 256-bit hash
	You can search a program's hash value in VirusTotal or OPSWAT

IP Addresses (Easy)
	Domain Names (Simple)
		You can see the actual website the shortened link is redirecting you to by appending "+" to it.
	Punycode Attack:
		Using similar or Unicode ASCII encoded symbols in a URL to deceive. 
Host Artifacts (Annoying)
	Host Artifacts are traces or observables that attackers leave on the system.
Network Artifacts (Annoying)
	Same as Host Artifacts but in the network space, can be observed using tools like Wireshark or IDSs.
Tools (Challenging)
	Malicious tools (macros, backdoors, custom .EXE, .DLL, payloads,...)
	Fuzzy Hashing: helps to id two files with minor differences based on the hash values (SSDEEP).
TTPs (Tough)
	Tactics, Techniques & Procedures. If you fight against an adversary TTPs, you leave them almost no chance to fight back.
