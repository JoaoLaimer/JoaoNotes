The DREAD framework is a risk assessment model developed by Microsoft to evaluate and priorities security threats and vulnerabilities.
The DREAD Framework is typically used for Qualitative Risk Analysis, rating each category from one to ten based on a subjective assessment and interpretation of the questions above. Moreover, the average score of all criteria will calculate the overall DREAD risk rating.
## **D**amage
The potential harm that could result form the successful exploitation of a vulnerability. This include data loss, system downtime, or reputation damage.
## **R**eproducibility
The ease with which an attacker can successfully recreate the exploitation of a vulnerability. A higher reproducibility score suggests that the vulnerability is easier to abuse.
## **E**xploitability
The difficulty level involved in exploiting the vulnerability considering factors such as technical skills required availability of tools or exploits, and the amount of time it would take to exploit the vulnerability successfully.
## **A**ffected User
The number or portion of users impacted once the vulnerability has been exploited.
## **D**iscoverability
The ease with which an attacker can find and identify the vulnerability considering whether it is publicly known or how difficult it is to discover based on the exposure of the assets (publicly reachable or in a regulated environment).
#### Summary
- **Damage** - How bad would an attack be?
- **Reproducibility** - How easy is it to reproduce the attack?
- **Exploitability** - How much work is it to launch the attack?
- **Affected Users** - How many people will be impacted?
- **Discoverability** - How easy is it to discover the vulnerability?
## Framework Guidelines
1. Establish a standardized set of guidelines and definitions for each DREAD category that provides a consistent understanding of how rate vulnerabilities. 
2. Encourage collaboration and discussion among multiple teams.
3. Use the DREAD framework with other risk-assessment methodologies and regularly review and update the chosen methods and techniques to ensure they remain relevant and aligned with the organisation's needs.
