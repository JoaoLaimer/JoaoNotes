Writing PHP code in a field we control that gets logged into a log file (i.e. `poison`/`contaminate` the log file), and then include that log file to execute the PHP code.
## PHP Session Poisoning
Most PHP web applications utilize `PHPSESSID` cookies, which can hold specific user-related data on the back-end, so the web application can keep track of user details through their cookies. These details are stored in `session` files on the back-end, and saved in `/var/lib/php/sessions/` on Linux and in `C:\Windows\Temp\` on Windows. The name of the file that contains our user's data matches the name of our `PHPSESSID` cookie with the `sess_` prefix. For example, if the `PHPSESSID` cookie is set to `el4ukv0kqbvoirg7nkp4dncpk3`, then its location on disk would be `/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_el4ukv0kqbvoirg7nkp4dncpk3`.

```url
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=%3C%3Fphp%20system%28%24_GET%5B%22cmd%22%5D%29%3B%3F%3E
```
Finally, we can include the session file and use the `&cmd=id` to execute a commands:
```
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_nhhv8i0o6ua4g88bkdl9u1fdsd&cmd=id
```

## Server Log Poisoning
Both `Apache` and `Nginx` maintain various log files, such as `access.log` and `error.log`. The `access.log` file contains various information about all requests made to the server, including each request's `User-Agent` header. As we can control the `User-Agent` header in our requests, we can use it to poison the server logs as we did above.

Once poisoned, we need to include the logs through the LFI vulnerability, and for that we need to have read-access over the logs. `Nginx` logs are readable by low privileged users by default (e.g. `www-data`), while the `Apache` logs are only readable by users with high privileges (e.g. `root`/`adm` groups). However, in older or misconfigured `Apache` servers, these logs may be readable by low-privileged users.

By default, `Apache` logs are located in `/var/log/apache2/` on Linux and in `C:\xampp\apache\logs\` on Windows, while `Nginx` logs are located in `/var/log/nginx/` on Linux and in `C:\nginx\log\` on Windows.

```shell
curl -s "http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php" -H "User-Agent: <?php system(\$_GET['cmd']); ?>"
```
As the log should now contain PHP code, the LFI vulnerability should execute this code, and we should be able to gain remote code execution. We can specify a command to be executed with (`&cmd=id`).

Finally, there are other similar log poisoning techniques that we may utilize on various system logs, depending on which logs we have read access over. The following are some of the service logs we may be able to read:

- `/var/log/sshd.log`
- `/var/log/mail`
- `/var/log/vsftpd.log`
