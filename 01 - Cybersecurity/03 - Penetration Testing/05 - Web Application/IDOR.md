w`Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)` vulnerabilities are among the most common web vulnerabilities and can significantly impact the vulnerable web application. IDOR vulnerabilities occur when a web application exposes a direct reference to an object, like a file or a database resource, which the end-user can directly control to obtain access to other similar objects. If any user can access any resource due to the lack of a solid access control system, the system is considered to be vulnerable.

## URL Parameters & APIs
The very first step of exploiting IDOR vulnerabilities is identifying Direct Object References. Whenever we receive a specific file or resource, we should study the HTTP requests to look for URL parameters or APIs with an object reference (e.g. `?uid=1` or `?filename=file_1.pdf`). These are mostly found in URL parameters or APIs but may also be found in other HTTP headers, like cookies.

## AJAX Calls
The following example shows a basic example of an AJAX call:
```javascript
function changeUserPassword() {
    $.ajax({
        url:"change_password.php",
        type: "post",
        dataType: "json",
        data: {uid: user.uid, password: user.password, is_admin: is_admin},
        success:function(result){
            //
        }
    });
}
```
The above function may never be called when we use the web application as a non-admin user. However, if we locate it in the front-end code, we may test it in different ways to see whether we can call it to perform changes, which would indicate that it is vulnerable to IDOR. We can do the same with back-end code if we have access to it (e.g., open-source web applications).

## Compare User Roles

If we want to perform more advanced IDOR attacks, we may need to register multiple users and compare their HTTP requests and object references. This may allow us to understand how the URL parameters and unique identifiers are being calculated and then calculate them for other users to gather their data.
For example, if we had access to two different users, one of which can view their salary after making the following API call:
```json
{
  "attributes" : 
    {
      "type" : "salary",
      "url" : "/services/data/salaries/users/1"
    },
  "Id" : "1",
  "Name" : "User1"

}
```

The second user may not have all of these API parameters to replicate the call and should not be able to make the same call as `User1`. However, with these details at hand, we can try repeating the same API call while logged in as `User2` to see if the web application returns anything. Such cases may work if the web application only requires a valid logged-in session to make the API call but has no access control on the back-end to compare the caller's session with the 
data being called.

# Mass IDOR Enumeration
## Insecure Parameters
Let's start with a basic example that showcases a typical IDOR vulnerability..
`/documents.php?uid=1`:
When we get to the `Documents` page, we see several documents that belong to our user. These can be files uploaded by our user or files set for us by another department (e.g., HR Department). Checking the file links, we see that they have individual names:
```html
/documents/Invoice_1_09_2021.pdf
/documents/Report_1_10_2021.pdf
```
We see that the files have a predictable naming pattern, as the file names appear to be using the user `uid` and the month/year as part of the file name, which may allow us to fuzz files for other users.

We can try manually accessing other employee documents with `uid=3`, `uid=4`, and so on. However, manually accessing files is not efficient in a real work environment with hundreds or thousands of employees.
We can pick any unique word to be able to `grep` the link of the file. In our case, we see that each link starts with `<li class='pure-tree_link'>`.
Now, we can use a simple `for` loop to loop over the `uid` parameter and return the document of all employees, and then use `wget` to download each document link:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

url="http://SERVER_IP:PORT"

for i in {1..10}; do
        for link in $(curl -s "$url/documents.php?uid=$i" | grep -oP "\/documents.*?.pdf"); do
                wget -q $url/$link
        done
done
```
