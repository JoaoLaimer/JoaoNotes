## Determine Firewalls and Their Rules
The packets can either be `dropped`, or `rejected`. The `dropped` packets are ignored, and no response is returned from the host.

This is different for rejected packets, which elicit an explicit response. TCP packets are returned with an RST flag, while ICMP can contain different types of error codes.

Such errors include:

- Net Unreachable
- Net Prohibited
- Host Unreachable
- Host Prohibited
- Port Unreachable
- Proto Unreachable

Nmap's TCP ACK scan (`-sA`) method is much harder to filter for firewalls and IDS/IPS systems than regular SYN (`-sS`) or Connect scans (`sT`) because they only send a TCP packet with only the `ACK` flag. When a port is closed or open, the host must respond with an `RST` flag.

# Detect IDS/IPS
- `IDS systems` alone are usually there to help administrators detect potential attacks on their network. They can then decide how to handle such connections. We can trigger certain security measures from an administrator, for example, by aggressively scanning a single port and its service. Based on whether specific security measures are taken, we can detect if the network has some monitoring applications or not.
- One method to determine whether such `IPS system` is present in the target network is to scan from a single host (`VPS`). If at any time this host is blocked and has no access to the target network, we know that the administrator has taken some security measures. Accordingly, we can continue our penetration test with another `VPS`.

Consequently, we know that we need to be quieter with our scans and, in the best case, disguise all interactions with the target network and its services.
# Decoys
There are cases in which administrators block specific subnets from different regions in principle. This prevents any access to the target network. Another example is when IPS should block us. For this reason, the Decoy scanning method (`-D`) is the right choice. With this method, Nmap generates various random IP addresses inserted into the IP header to disguise the origin of the packet sent. With this method, we can generate random (`RND`) a specific number (for example: `5`) of IP addresses separated by a colon (`:`). Our real IP address is then randomly placed between the generated IP addresses.
```shell
$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -D RND:5
```
The spoofed packets are often filtered out by ISPs and routers, even though they come from the same network range. Therefore, we can also specify our VPS servers' IP addresses and use them in combination with "`IP ID`" manipulation in the IP headers to scan the target.

# DNS Proxying
`Nmap` still gives us a way to specify DNS servers ourselves (`--dns-server <ns>,<ns>`). This method could be fundamental to us if we are in a demilitarized zone (`DMZ`). The company's DNS servers are usually more trusted than those from the Internet. So, for example, we could use them to interact with the hosts of the internal network. As another example, we can use `TCP port 53` as a source port (`--source-port`) for our scans. If the administrator uses the firewall to control this port and does not filter IDS/IPS properly, our TCP packets will be trusted and passed through.
