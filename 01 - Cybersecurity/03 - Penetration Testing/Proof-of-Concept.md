`Proof of Concept` (`PoC`) or `Proof of Principle` is a project management term. In project management, it serves as proof that a project is feasible in principle. The criteria for this can lie in technical or business factors.

A `PoC` can have many different representations. For example, `documentation` of the vulnerabilities found can also constitute a PoC. The more practical version of a PoC is a `script` or `code` that automatically exploits the vulnerabilities found. This demonstrates the flawless exploitation of the vulnerabilities. This variant is straightforward for an administrator or developer because they can see what steps our script takes to exploit the vulnerability.

However, there is one significant disadvantage that has occurred from time to time. Once the administrators and developers have received such a script from us, it is easy for them to "fight" against our script. They focus on changing the systems so that the script we created no longer works. The important thing is that the script is only `one way` of exploiting a given vulnerability. Therefore, working against our script instead of with it and modifying and securing the systems so that our script no longer works does not mean that the information obtained from the script cannot be obtained in another way. It is an important aspect that should be discussed with the administrators and developers and explicitly mentioned and pointed out.
