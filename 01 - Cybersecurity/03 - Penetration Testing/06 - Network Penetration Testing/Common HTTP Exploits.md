## Malicious iFrames
An iFrame is an HTML element that allows the browser to load another web page from another source. iFrame attacks have become very common, as they are often used to insert advertisements from other sources into the page. Threat actors compromise a webserver and modify web pages by adding HTML for the malicious iFrame. The HTML links to the threat actor’s webserver. In some instances, the iFrame page that is loaded consists of only a few pixels. This makes it very hard for the user to see. Because the iFrame is run in the page, it can be used to deliver a malicious exploit, such as spam advertising, an exploit kit, and other malware.
These are some of the ways to prevent or reduce malicious iFrames:
- Use a web proxy to block malicious sites.
- Because attackers often change the source HTML of the iFrame in a compromised web site, make sure web developers do not use iFrames. This will isolate any content from third-party web sites and make modified pages easier to find.
- Use a service such as Cisco Umbrella to prevent users from navigating to web sites that are known to be malicious.
- Make sure the end user understands what an iFrame is. Threat actors often use this method in web-based attacks.
## HTTP 302 Cushioning
Another type of HTTP attack is the HTTP 302 cushioning attack. Threat actors use the 302 Found HTTP response status code to direct the user’s web browser to a new location. Threat actors often use legitimate HTTP functions such as HTTP redirects to carry out their attacks. HTTP allows servers to redirect a client’s HTTP request to a different server. HTTP redirection is used, for example, when web content has moved to a different URL or domain name. This allows old URLs and bookmarks to continue to function. Therefore, security analysts should understand how a function such as HTTP redirection works and how it can be used during attacks.
When the response from the server is a 302 Found status, it also provides the URL in the location field. The browser believes that the new location is the URL provided in the header. The browser is invited to request this new URL. This redirect function can be used multiple times until the browser finally lands on the page that contains the exploit. The redirects may be difficult to detect due to the fact that legitimate redirects frequently occur on the network.

## Domain Shadowing
When a threat actor wishes to create a domain shadowing attack, the threat actor must first compromise a domain. Then, the threat actor must create multiple subdomains of that domain to be used for the attacks. Hijacked domain registration logins are then used to create the many subdomains needed. After these subdomains have been created, attackers can use them as they wish, even if they are found out to be malicious domains.The following sequence is typically used by threat actors:
1. A website becomes compromised.
2. HTTP 302 cushioning is used to send the browser to malicious websites.
3. Domain shadowing is used to direct the browser to a compromised server.
4. An exploit kit landing page is accessed.
5. Malware downloads from the exploit kit landing page.
