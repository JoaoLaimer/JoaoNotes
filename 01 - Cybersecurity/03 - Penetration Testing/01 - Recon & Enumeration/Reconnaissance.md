## Active Reconnaissance
Involves interacting directly with the target system to gather information:

| Technique              | Description                                                                                  | Tools                                           | Risk of Detection                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Port Scanning          | Identifying open ports and services running on the target.                                   | [[Nmap]], [[Masscan]], [[Unicornscan]]          | High: Direct interaction with the target can trigger intrusion detection systems (IDS) and firewalls.              |
| Vulnerability Scanning | Probing the target for known vulnerabilities, such as outdated software or misconfiguration. | [[Nessus]], [[OpenVAS]], [[Nikto]]              | High: Vulnerability scanners send exploit payloads that security solutions can detect.                             |
| Network Mapping        | Mapping the target's network topology, including connected devices and their relationships.  | [[Traceroute]], [[Nmap]]                        | Medium to High: Excessive or unusual network traffic can  raise suspicion.                                         |
| Banner Grabbing        | Retrieving information from banners displayed by services running on the target.             | [[Netcat]], [[curl]]                            | Low: Banner grabbing typically involves minimal interaction but can still be logged.                               |
| OS Fingerprinting      | Identifying the operating system running on the target.                                      | [[Nmap]], [[Xprobe2]]                           | Low: OS fingerprinting is usually passive, but some advanced techniques can be detected.                           |
| Service Enumeration    | Determining the specific version of services running on open ports                           | [[Nmap]]                                        | Low: Similar to banner grabbing, service enumeration can be logged but is less likely to trigger alerts.           |
| Web Spidering          | Crawling the target website to identify web pages, directories, and files.                   | [[BurpSuite]] Spider, [[OWASP ZAP]], [[Scrapy]] | Low to Medium: Can be detected if the crawler's behaviour is not carefully configured to mimic legitimate traffic. |
## Passive Reconnaissance
passive reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target `without directly interacting` with it.

| Technique             | Description                                                                                                                                | Tools                                                                       | Risk of Detection                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Search Engine Queries | Utilising search engines to uncover information about the target, including websites, social media profiles, and news articles.            | Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, and specialised search engines (e.g., [[Shodan]]) | Very Low: Search engine queries are normal internet activity and unlikely to trigger alerts.           |
| WHOIS Lookups         | Querying WHOIS databases to retrieve domain registration details.                                                                          | whois command-line tool, online [[WHOIS]] lookup services                   | Very Low: WHOIS queries are legitimate and do not raise suspicion.                                     |
| DNS                   | Analysing DNS records to identify subdomains, mail servers, and other infrasctructure.,                                                    | dig, nslookup, host, dnsenum, fierce, dnsrecon                              | Very Low: DNS queries are essential for internet browsing and are not typically flagged as suspicious. |
| Web Archive Analysis  | Examining historical snapshots of the target's website to identify changes, vulnerabilities, or hidden information.                        | Wayback Machine                                                             | Very Low: Accessing archived versions of websites is a normal activity.                                |
| Social Media Analysis | Gathering information from social media platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, or Facebook.                                                     | LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, specialised OSINT tools                        | Very Low: Accessing public social media profiles is not considered intrusive.                          |
| Code Repositories     | Searching GitHub for code snippets or repositories related to the target that might contain sensitive information or code vulnerabilities. | GitHub, GitLab                                                              | Very Low: Code repositories are meant for public access, and searching them is not suspicious.         |
