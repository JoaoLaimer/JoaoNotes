Obfuscation is a technique used to make a script more difficult to read by humans but allows it to function the same from a technical point of view, though performance may be slower.
## Minifying JavaScript code

A common way of reducing the readability of a snippet of JavaScript code while keeping it fully functional is JavaScript minification. `Code minification` means having the entire code in a single (often very long) line. `Code minification` is more useful for longer code, as if our code only consisted of a single line, it would not look much different when minified.

Many tools can help us minify JavaScript code, like [javascript-minifier](https://javascript-minifier.com/).
## Packing JavaScript code
A `packer` obfuscation tool usually attempts to convert all words and symbols of the code into a list or a dictionary and then refer to them using the `(p,a,c,k,e,d)` function to re-build the original code during execution. The `(p,a,c,k,e,d)` can be different from one packer to another. However, it usually contains a certain order in which the words and symbols of the original code were packed to know how to order them during execution.

## Deobfuscate

We can find many good online tools to deobfuscate JavaScript code and turn it into something we can understand. One good tool is [UnPacker](https://matthewfl.com/unPacker.html). Let's try copying our above-obfuscated code and run it in UnPacker by clicking the `UnPack` button.
