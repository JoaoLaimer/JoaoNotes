# 2.1.1 Elements of a SOC
Organizations typically use the services of professionals in a Security Operations Center (SOC). SOCs provide a broad range of services, from monitoring and management, to comprehensive threat solutions and hosted security that can be customized to meet customer needs. SOCs can be wholly in-house, owned and operated by a business, or elements of a SOC can be contracted out to security vendors. The major elements of a SOC, **are people, processes, and technologies.**
# 2.1.2 People in the SOC
- **Tier 1 Alert/Cybersecurity Analyst** - These professionals monitor incoming alerts, verify that a true incident has occurred, and forward tickets to Tier 2, if necessary.
- **Tier 2 Incident Responder**- These professionals are responsible for deep investigation of incidents and advise remediation or action to be taken.
- **Tier 3 Threat Hunter** - These professionals have expert-level skill in network, endpoint, threat intelligence, and malware reverse engineering. They are experts at tracing the processes of the malware to determine its impact and how it can be removed. They are also deeply involved in hunting for potential threats and implementing threat detection tools. Threat hunters search for cyber threats that are present in the network but have not yet been detected.
- **SOC Manager** - This professional manages all the resources of the SOC and serves as the point of contact for the larger organization or customer.

# 2.1.3 Process in the SOC
The day of a Cybersecurity Analyst typically begins with monitoring security alert queues. A ticketing system is frequently used to assign alerts to a queue for an analyst to investigate. Because the software that generates alerts can trigger false alarms, one job of the Cybersecurity Analyst might be to verify that an alert represents a true security incident. When verification is established, the incident can be forwarded to investigators or other security personnel to be acted upon. Otherwise, the alert may be dismissed as a false alarm.

If a ticket cannot be resolved, the Cybersecurity Analyst will forward the ticket to a Tier 2 Incident Responder for deeper investigation and remediation. If the Incident Responder cannot resolve the ticket, it will be forwarded it to Tier 3 personnel with in-depth knowledge and threat hunting skills.

- **Tier 1**
	- Monitors Incidents
	- Opens ticket
	- Basic threat mitigation
- **Tier 2**
	- Deep Investigation
	- Advises remediation
- **Tier 3**
	- In-depth Knowledge
	- Threat hunting
	- Preventive measures
# 2.1.4 Technologies in the SOC - SIEM
SIEM systems are used for collecting and filtering data, detecting and classifying threats, and analyzing and investigating threats. SIEM systems may also and manage resources to implement preventive measures and address future threats. SOC technologies include one or more of the following:

- Event collection, correlation, and analysis
- Security monitoring
- Security control
- Log management
- Vulnerability assessment
- Vulnerability tracking
- Threat intelligence
# 2.1.5 Technologies in the SOC - SOAR
SIEM and security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) are often paired together as they have capabilities that complement each other.
SOAR platforms are similar to SIEMs in that they aggregate, correlate, and analyze alerts. However, SOAR technology goes a step further by integrating threat intelligence and automating incident investigation and response workflows based on playbooks developed by the security team.
- **Security**
- **Orchestration**: Creates a customized platform that integrates and coordinates numerous security tools and resources.
- **Automation**: Executes security processes with a minimum amount of human intervention. Helps address the shortage in cybersecurity analyst talent and increases efficiency.
- **Response**: Prescribes and executes security procedures to be followed in response to security events. Can be in the form of a security runbooks that consist of rule-based automated responses that were created to address specific types of events.

SOAR security platforms:
- Gather alarm data from each component of the system.
- Provide tools that enable cases to be researched, assessed, and investigated.
- Emphasize integration as a means of automating complex incident response workflows that enable more rapid response and adaptive defense strategies.
- Include pre-defined playbooks that enable automatic response to specific threats. Playbooks can be initiated automatically based on predefined rules or may be triggered by security personnel.

SIEM systems necessarily produce more alerts than most SecOps teams can realistically investigate in order to conservatively capture as many potential exploits as possible. SOAR will process many of these alerts automatically and will enable security personnel to focus on more complex and potentially damaging exploits.
# 2.1.6 SOC Metrics
Many metrics, or key performance indicators (KPI) can be devised to measure different specific aspects of SOC performance. However, five metrics are commonly used as SOC metrics.
- **Dwell Time** - the length of time that threat actors have access to a network before they are detected, and their access is stopped.
- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)** - the average time that it takes for the SOC personnel to identify valid security incidents have occurred in the network.
- **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)** - the average time that it takes to stop and remediate a security incident.
- **Mean Time to Contain (MTTC)** - the time required to stop the incident from causing further damage to systems or data.
- **Time to Control** - the time required to stop the spread of malware in the network.
# 2.1.7 Enterprise and Managed Security
For medium and large networks, the organization will benefit from implementing an enterprise-level SOC. The SOC can be a complete in-house solution. However, many larger organizations will outsource at least part of the SOC operations to a security solutions provider.
Cisco has a team of experts who help ensure timely and accurate incident resolution. Cisco offers a wide range of incident response, preparedness, and management capabilities including:

- Cisco Smart Net Total Care Service for Rapid Problem Resolution
- Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT)
- Cisco Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)
- Cisco Managed Services
- Cisco Tactical Operations (TacOps)
- Cisco’s Safety and Physical Security Program
# 2.1.8 DevSecOps
DevSecOps stands for Development, Security, and Operations. It is a practice that integrates security into the DevOps (Development and Operations) process, with the goal of making security an integral part of the software development lifecycle rather than something that is added at the end. By incorporating security from the beginning, DevSecOps aims to reduce vulnerabilities and improve the overall security of applications, systems, and environments.
## DevSecOps provides:

- **Faster Remediation:** Security issues are identified early, reducing the time and cost to fix them.
- **Reduced Risk:** Continuous security checks minimize the chances of vulnerabilities making it to production.
- **Increased Efficiency:** Automating security tasks allows teams to focus on their core responsibilities while ensuring that security is not neglected.
- **Improved Collaboration:** Security is a shared responsibility, improving communication and teamwork between developers, security, and operations teams.
DevSecOps aims to create a culture of security where security is everyone’s responsibility, and it is woven into every part of the development lifecycle. By integrating security into development processes, organizations can build more secure software, mitigate risks faster, and create a more resilient infrastructure.

# 2.1.9 Security vs. Availability
Each business or industry has a limited tolerance for network downtime. That tolerance is usually based upon a comparison of the cost of the downtime in relation to the cost of ensuring against downtime.
Preferred uptime is often measured in the number of down minutes in a year, as shown in the table.

| Availability %          | Downtime      |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| 99.8%                   | 17.52 hours   |
| 99.9% (Three Nines)     | 8.76 hours    |
| 99.99% (Four Nines)     | 52.56 minutes |
| 99.999% (Five Nines)    | 5.256 minutes |
| 99.9999% (Six Nines)    | 31.56 seconds |
| 99.99999% (Seven Nines) | 3.16 seconds  |
However, security cannot be so strong that it interferes with the needs of employees or business functions. It is always a tradeoff between strong security and permitting efficient business functioning.
