# 3.1.1 Disk Operating System
The Disk Operating System (DOS) is an operating system that the computer uses to enable these data storage devices to read and write files. DOS provides a file system which organizes the files in a specific way on the disk. Microsoft bought DOS and developed MS-DOS.
Early versions of Windows consisted of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that ran over MS-DOS, starting with Windows 1.0 in 1985. The disk operating system still controlled the computer and its hardware. A modern operating system like Windows 10 is not considered a disk operating system. It is built on Windows NT, which stands for “New Technologies”. The operating system itself is in direct control of the computer and its hardware. NT is an OS with support for multiple user processes. This is much different than the single-process, single-user MS-DOS.

# 3.1.2 Windows Versions
Since 1993, there have been more than 20 releases of Windows that are based on the NT operating system. Most of these versions were for use by the general public and businesses because of the file security offered by the file system that was used by the NT OS. Businesses also adopted NT OS-based Windows operating systems. This is because many editions were built specifically for workstation, professional, server, advanced server, and datacenter server, to name just a few of the many purpose-built versions.

Beginning with Windows XP, a 64-bit edition was available.

Windows 7 was offered with six different editions, Windows 8 with as many as five, and Windows 10 with eight different editions!

# 3.1.3 Windows GUI
The Desktop can be customized with various colors and background images. Windows supports multiple users, so each user can customize the Desktop to their liking. The Desktop can store files, folders, shortcuts to locations and programs, and applications. The Desktop also has a recycle bin icon, where files are stored when the user deletes them. Files can be restored from the recycle bin or the recycle bin can be emptied of files, which truly deletes them.

At the bottom of the desktop is the Task Bar. The Task Bar has three areas that are used for different purposes. At the left is the Start menu. It is used to access all of the installed programs, configuration options, and the search feature. At the center of the Task Bar, users place quick launch icons that run specific programs or open specific folders when they are clicked. Finally, on the right of the Task Bar is the notification area. The notification area shows, at a glance, the functionality of many different programs and features. For example, a blinking envelope icon may indicate new email, or a network icon with a red “x” may indicate a problem with the network.

Often, right-clicking an icon will bring up additional functions that can be used. This list is known as a Context Menu.

Windows OS Security recommendations.

| **Recommendation**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Virus or malware protection** | - By default, Windows uses Windows Defender for malware protection.<br>- Windows Defender provides a suite of protection tools built into the system.<br>- If Windows Defender is turned off, the system becomes more vulnerable to attacks and malware.                                                                                                                         |
| **Encryption**                  | - When data is not encrypted, it can easily be gathered and exploited.<br>- This is not only important for desktop computers, but especially mobile devices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Security policy**             | - A good security policy must be configured and followed.<br>- Many settings in the Windows Security Policy control can prevent attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Firewall**                    | - By default, Windows uses Windows Firewall to limit communication with devices on the network.<br>- Over time, rules may no longer apply.<br>- For example, a port may be left open that should no longer be readily available.<br>- It is important to review firewall settings periodically to ensure that the rules are still applicable and remove any that no longer apply |
| **File and share permissions**  | - These permissions must be set correctly.<br>- It is easy to just give the “Everyone” group Full Control, but this allows all people to do what they want to all files.<br>- It is best to provide each user or group with the minimum necessary permissions for all files and folders.                                                                                         |
| **Weak or no password**         | - Many people choose weak passwords or do not use a password at all.<br>- It is especially important to make sure that all accounts, especially the Administrator account, have a very strong password.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Login as Administrator**      | - When a user logs in as an administrator, any program that they run will have the privileges of that account.<br>- It is best to log in as a Standard User and only use the administrator password to accomplish certain tasks.                                                                                                                                                 |
