# 8.1.1 Destination on Same Network
There are two primary addresses assigned to a device on an Ethernet LAN:

- **Physical address (the MAC address)** - This is used for Ethernet NIC to Ethernet NIC communications on the same network.
- **Logical address (the IP address)** - This is used to send the packet from the original source to the final destination.

IP addresses are used to identify the address of the original source device and the final destination device. The destination IP address may be on the same IP network as the source or may be on a remote network.
The Layer 2 Ethernet frame contains:

- **Destination MAC address** - This is the MAC address of the file server’s Ethernet NIC.
- **Source MAC address** - This is the MAC address of PC-A’s Ethernet NIC.

The Layer 3 IP packet contains:

- **Source IP address** - This is the IP address of the original source, PC-A.
- **Destination IP address** - This is the IP address of the final destination, the file server. 
# 8.1.2 Destination on Remote Network
When the destination IP address is on a remote network, the destination MAC address will be the address of the host’s default gateway.
