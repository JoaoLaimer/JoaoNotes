# 11.2.2 Wireless versus Wired LANs
WLANs use Radio Frequencies (RF) instead of cables at the physical layer and MAC sublayer of the data link layer. WLANs share a similar origin with Ethernet LANs. The IEEE has adopted the 802 LAN/MAN portfolio of computer network architecture standards. The two dominant 802 working groups are 802.3 Ethernet, which defined Ethernet for wired LANs, and 802.11 which defined Ethernet for WLANs. There are important differences between the two.
WLANs also differ from wired LANs as follows:

  - WLANs connect clients to the network through a wireless access point (AP) or wireless router, instead of an Ethernet switch.</
  - WLANs connect mobile devices that are often battery powered, as opposed to plugged-in LAN devices. Wireless NICs tend to reduce the battery life of a mobile device.
  - WLANs support hosts that contend for access on the RF media (frequency bands). 802.11 prescribes collision-avoidance (CSMA/CA) instead of collision-detection (CSMA/CD) for media access to proactively avoid collisions within the media.
  - WLANs use a different frame format than wired Ethernet LANs. WLANs require additional information in the Layer 2 header of the frame.
  - WLANs raise more privacy issues because radio frequencies can reach outside the facility.

# 11.2.3 802.11 Frame Structure
![[802.11frame.png]]
All 802.11 wireless frames contain the following fields:
<ul>
<li><strong>Frame Control</strong> - This identifies the type of wireless frame and contains subfields for protocol version, frame type, address type, power management, and security settings.</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong> - This is typically used to indicate the remaining duration needed to receive the next frame transmission.</li>
<li><strong>Address1</strong> - This usually contains the MAC address of the receiving wireless device or AP.</li>
<li><strong>Address2</strong> - This usually contains the MAC address of the transmitting wireless device or AP.</li>
<li><strong>Address3</strong> - This sometimes contains the MAC address of the destination, such as the router interface (default gateway) to which the AP is attached.</li>
<li><strong>Sequence Control</strong> - This contains information to control sequencing and fragmented frames.</li>
<li><strong>Address4</strong> - This usually missing because it is used only in ad hoc mode.</li>
<li><strong>Payload</strong> - This contains the data for transmission.</li>
<li><strong>FCS</strong> - This is used for Layer 2 error control.</li>
</ul>
# 11.2.4 CSMA/CA
WLANs are half-duplex, shared media configurations. Half-duplex means that only one client can transmit or receive at any given moment. Shared media means that wireless clients can all transmit and receive on the same radio channel. This creates a problem because a wireless client cannot hear while it is sending, which makes it impossible to detect a collision.

To resolve this problem, WLANs use carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) as the method to determine how and when to send data on the network. A wireless client does the following:


1. Listens to the channel to see if it is idle, which means that is senses no other traffic is currently on the channel. The channel is also called the carrier.
2. Sends a ready to send (RTS) message to the AP to request dedicated access to the network.
3. Receives a clear to send (CTS) message from the AP granting access to send.
4. If the wireless client does not receive a CTS message, it waits a random amount of time before restarting the process.
5. After it receives the CTS, it transmits the data.
6. All transmissions are acknowledged. If a wireless client does not receive an acknowledgment, it assumes a collision occurred and restarts the process.
# 11.2.5 Wireless Client and AP Association
For wireless devices to communicate over a network, they must first associate with an AP or wireless router.

In order to have a successful association, a wireless client and an AP must agree on specific parameters. Parameters must then be configured on the AP and subsequently on the client to enable the negotiation of a successful association.
<ul>
<li><strong>SSID</strong> -The SSID name appears in the list of available wireless networks on a client. In larger organizations that use multiple VLANs to segment traffic, each SSID is mapped to one VLAN. Depending on the network configuration, several APs on a network can share a common SSID.</li>
<li><strong>Password</strong> - This is required from the wireless client to authenticate to the AP.</li>
<li><strong>Network mode</strong> - This refers to the 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ad WLAN standards. APs and wireless routers can operate in a Mixed mode meaning that they can simultaneously support clients connecting via multiple standards.</li>
<li><strong>Security mode</strong> - This refers to the security parameter settings, such as WEP, WPA, or WPA2. Always enable the highest security level supported.</li>
<li><strong>Channel settings</strong> - This refers to the frequency bands used to transmit wireless data. Wireless routers and APs can scan the radio frequency channels and automatically select an appropriate channel setting. The channel can also be set manually if there is interference with another AP or wireless device.</li>
</ul>
# 11.2.6 Passive and Active Discover Mode
Wireless devices must discover and connect to an AP or wireless router. Wireless clients connect to the AP using a scanning (probing) process. This process can be passive or active.
**Passive Mode**
In passive mode, the AP openly advertises its service by periodically sending broadcast beacon frames containing the SSID, supported standards, and security settings. The primary purpose of the beacon is to allow wireless clients to learn which networks and APs are available in a given area. This allows the wireless clients to choose which network and AP to use.

**Active Mode**
In active mode, wireless clients must know the name of the SSID. The wireless client initiates the process by broadcasting a probe request frame on multiple channels. The probe request includes the SSID name and standards supported. APs configured with the SSID will send a probe response that includes the SSID, supported standards, and security settings. Active mode may be required if an AP or wireless router is configured to not broadcast beacon frames.

# 11.2.8 Wireless Devices - AP, LWAP, and WLC
All of the control and management functions of the APs on a network can be centralized into a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC). When using a WLC, the APs no longer act autonomously, but instead act as lightweight APs (LWAPs). LWAPs only forward data between the wireless LAN and the WLC. All management functions, such as defining SSIDs and authentication are conducted on the centralized WLC rather than on each individual AP. A major benefit of centralizing the AP management functions in the WLC is simplified configuration and monitoring of numerous access points, among many other benefits.
