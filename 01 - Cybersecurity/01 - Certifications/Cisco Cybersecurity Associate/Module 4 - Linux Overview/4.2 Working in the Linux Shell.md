# 4.2.1 The Linux Shell
In Linux, the user communicates with the OS by using the CLI or the GUI. Linux often starts in the GUI by default. This hides the CLI from the user. One way to access the CLI from the GUI is through a terminal emulator application. These applications provide user access to the CLI and are often named as some variation of the word "terminal". In Linux, popular terminal emulators are Terminator, eterm, xterm, konsole, and gnome-terminal.

# 4.2.4 Working with Text Files
While graphical text editors are convenient and easy to use, command line-based text editors are very important for Linux users. The main benefit of command-line-based text editors is that they allow for text file editing from a remote computer.
# 4.2.5 The Importance of Text Files in Linux
In Linux, everything is treated as a file. This includes the memory, the disks, the monitor, and the directories.
