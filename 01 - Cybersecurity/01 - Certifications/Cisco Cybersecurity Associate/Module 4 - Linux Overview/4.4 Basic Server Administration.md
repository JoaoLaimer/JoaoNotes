# 4.4.1 Service Configuration Files
In Linux, services are managed using configuration files. Common options in configuration files are port number, location of the hosted resources, and client authorization details. When the service starts, it looks for its configuration files, loads them into memory, and adjusts itself according to the settings in the files. Configuration file modifications often require restarting the service before the changes take effect.

Because services often require superuser privileges to run, service configuration files often require superuser privileges to edit.
# 4.4.2 Hardening Devices
The following are basic best practices for device hardening.

- Ensure physical security
- Minimize installed packages
- Disable unused services
- Use SSH and disable the root account login over SSH
- Keep the system updated
- Disable USB auto-detection
- Enforce strong passwords
- Force periodic password changes
- Keep users from re-using old passwords

Many other steps exist and are often service or application-dependent.
# 4.4.3 Monitoring Service Logs
In Linux, log files can be categorized as:
- Application logs
- Event logs
- Service logs
- System logs

|**Linux Log File**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**/var/log/messages**|- This directory contains generic computer activity logs.<br>- It is mainly used to store informational and non-critical system messages.<br>- In Debian-based computers, /var/log/syslog directory serves the same purpose.|
|**/var/log/auth.log**|- This file stores all authentication-related events in Debian and Ubuntu computers.<br>- Anything involving the user authorization mechanism can be found in this file.|
|**/var/log/secure**|- This directory is used by RedHat and CentOS computers instead of /var/log/auth.log.<br>- It also tracks sudo logins, SSH logins, and other errors logged by SSSD.|
|**/var/log/boot.log**|- This file stores boot-related information and messages logged during the computer startup process.|
|**/var/log/dmesg**|- This directory contains kernel ring buffer messages.<br>- Information related to hardware devices and their drivers is recorded here.<br>- It is very important because, due to their low-level nature, logging systems such as syslog are not running when these events take place and therefore are often unavailable to the administrator in real-time.|
|**/var/log/kern.log**|- This file contains information logged by the kernel.|
|**/var/log/cron**|- Cron is a service used to schedule automated tasks in Linux and this directory stores its events.<br>- Whenever a scheduled task (also called a cron job) runs, all its relevant information including execution status and error messages are stored here.|
|**/var/log/mysqld.log** or **/var/log/mysql.log**|- This is the MySQL log file.<br>- All debug, failure and success messages related to the mysqld process and mysqld_safe daemon are logged here.<br>- RedHat, CentOS and Fedora Linux distributions store MySQL logs under /var/log/mysqld.log, while Debian and Ubuntu maintain the log in /var/log/mysql.log file.|
