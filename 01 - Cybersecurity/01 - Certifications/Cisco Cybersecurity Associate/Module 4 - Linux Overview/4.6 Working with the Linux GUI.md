# 4.6.1 X Window System
The graphical interface present in most Linux computers is based on the X Window System. Also known as X or X11, X Window is a windowing system designed to provide the basic framework for a GUI. X includes functions for drawing and moving windows on the display device and interacting with a mouse and keyboard.

X works as a server which allows a remote user to use the network to connect, start a graphical application, and have the graphical window open on the remote terminal. While the application itself runs on the server, the graphical aspect of it is sent by X over the network and displayed on the remote computer.
