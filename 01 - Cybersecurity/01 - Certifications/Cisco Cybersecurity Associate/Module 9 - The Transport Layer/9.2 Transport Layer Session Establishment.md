# 9.2.4 TCP Three-way Handshake Analysis
These are the functions of the three-way handshake:

- It establishes that the destination device is present on the network.
- It verifies that the destination device has an active service and is accepting requests on the destination port number that the initiating client intends to use.
- It informs the destination device that the source client intends to establish a communication session on that port number.

The six bits in the Control Bits field of the TCP segment header are also known as flags. A flag is a bit that is set to either on or off.
**Control Bits Field**
The six control bits flags are as follows:

- **URG** - Urgent pointer field significant
- **ACK** - Acknowledgment flag used in connection establishment and session termination
- **PSH** - Push function
- **RST** - Reset the connection when an error or timeout occurs
- **SYN** - Synchronize sequence numbers used in connection establishment
- **FIN** - No more data from sender and used in session termination
