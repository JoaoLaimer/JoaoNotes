## Attacks
#### Pass The Hash Attack
Hacking technique that allows the attacker to authenticate to a remote server or service by using the underlying hash of a user's password instead of requiring the associated plain text password.
- **Mimikatz**: Provides the ability to automate the process of harvesting the hashes and conducting the attack.
#### Birthday Attack
Occurs when an attacker is able to send two different messages through a hash algorithm and it results in the same identical hash digest, referred to as a collision.
Birthday Paradox: "If you have a random group of people, there are high chances that you are going to have two people in that group with the same birthday"
#### Dictionary Attack
When an attacker tries every word from a predefined list.
#### Brute-Force Attack
When an attacker tries every possible password combination.
#### Rainbow Table
Precomputed tables for reversing cryptographic hash functions.
## Key Stretching
Technique that is used to mitigate a weaker key by increasing the time needed to crack it.
## Salting
Adding random data into a one-way cryptographic hash to help protect against password cracking techniques.
## Nonce
Stands for "number used once", is a unique, often random number that is added to password-based authentication process.
