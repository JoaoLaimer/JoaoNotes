Does not require a shared secret key, often referred as public key cryptography since their key is considered to be freely and openly available to the public.
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Authentication
- Non-repudiation
### Digital Signature
A hash digest of a message encrypted with the sender's private key to let the recipient know the document was created and sent by the person claiming to have sent it.
## Diffie-Hellman (DH)
Used to conduct key exchanges and secure key distribution over an unsecure network.
- Used for the key exchange inside of ceating a VPN tunnel establishment as part of IPSec or to be able to do a key exchange over the internet.
## RSA (Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman)
Asymmetric algorithm that relies on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.
- Can support key sizes up to 1024-bits and 4096-bits.
## Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
Heavily used in mobile devices and it's based on the algebraic structure of elliptical curves over finite fields to define its key.
- ECC with a 256-bit key is just as secure as RSA with a 2048-bit key.
#### Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
ECC version of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol.
#### Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral
Uses a different key for each portion of the key establishment process inside the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
#### Eliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
Used as public key encryption algorithm by the US Government in their digital signatures.
