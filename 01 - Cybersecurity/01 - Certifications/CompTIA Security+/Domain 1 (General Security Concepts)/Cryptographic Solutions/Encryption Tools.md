## Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 
Dedicated microcontroller designed to secure hardware through integrated cryptographic key.
## Hardware Security Module (HSM)
Physical device that safeguards and manages digital keys, primarily used for mission-critical situations like financial transactions.
Not only does an HSM securely generate cryptographic keys, but it also provides accelerated cryptographic operations.
## Key Management System
Integrated approach for generating, distributing and managing cryptographic keys for devices and application.
## Secure Enclave
Co-processor integrated into the main processor of some devices, designed with the sole purpose of ensuring data protection.
By keeping this data separate from the main processor, even if a device gets compromised, the data within the Secure Enclave remains untouched.
