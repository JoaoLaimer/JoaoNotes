***"Trust nothing and verify everything."***
Zero trust is a cyber security approach that assumes no user or system is trusted by default and requires continuous verification for access to organizational resources. 
Zero trust demands verification for every device, user, and transaction within the network, regardless of its origin.
# Control Plane
The overarching framework and set of components responsible for defining, managing, and enforcing the policies related to user and system access within an organization.
> Responsible for making determinations on access requests.
### Adaptive Identity
Real-time validation that takes into account the user's behavior, device, location, and more.
### Threat Scope Reduction
Limit the users's access to only what they need for their work tasks.
### Policy-Driven Access Control
Developing, managing and enforcing user access policies based on their roles.
### Secured Zones
Isolated environments within a network that are designed to house sensitive data.
#### Implicit Trust Zones
Implicit trust zones are areas within a network where communication is allowed without exhaustive security checks.

**Policy Engine**: Cross-references the access request with its predefined policies.
**Policy Administrator**: Used to **establish and manage** the access policies
# Data Plane
**Subject/System**: Refers to the individual or entity attempting to gain access.
**Policy Enforcement Point**: **Allow or restrict access**, act as a gatekeeper to the sensitive areas of the systems or networks.
> Manages the transmission of data.
