# CIA Information Triad
The CIA Triad is the foundation of everything we do in cybersecurity. It's one of the essential concepts listed in the Security+ exam objectives, and you should be very familiar with it when you take the exam. Try to relate each concept with one or three goal of confidentiality, integrity ans availability.
**[[Confidentiality]]**: Ensures that information is only accessible to those with the appropriate authorization.

**[[Integrity]]**: Ensures that data remains accurate and unaltered unless modification is required.

**[[Availability]]**: Ensures that information and resources ate accessible and functional when needed by authorized users.

### [[Non-Repudiation]]
Guaranteeing that a specific action or event has taken place cannot be denied by the parties involved.

# AAA of Security
**[[Authentication]]**: Process of verifying the identity of a user or system.
**[[Authorization]]**: Defines what actions or resources a user can access.
**[[Accounting]]**: Act of tracking user activities and resource usage, typically for audit or billing purposes.

### Security Controls 
Measures or mechanisms put in place to mitigate risks and protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems and data.
- [[Security Controls Categories]]: Technical, Managerial, Operational, Physical.
- [[Security Control Types]]: Preventative, Deterrent, Detective, Corrective, Compensating, Directive.
### [[Threats and Vulnerabilities]]
Threats acts on vulnerabilities.

### [[Zero Trust]]
Security model that operates on the principle that no one, whether inside or outside the organization, should be trusted by default.

 - **Control Plane**
 Consists of the adaptive identity, threat scope reduction, policy-driven access control, and secured zones.
 - **Data Plane**
 Focused on the subject/system, policy engine, policy administrator, and establishing policy enforcement points.
### [[Gap Analysis]]
Analyses the current organization security or performance posture and compares to an ideal posture to find differences and improvements opportunities.

> **Identification** occurs when a user claims an identity, such as with a username or email address. **Authentication** occurs when the user proves the claimed identity (such as with a password) and the credentials are verified (such as with a password). **Access control systems** provide **authorization** by granting access to resources based on permissions granted to the proves identity. **Logging** provides accounting.
