Physical security control that is designed to secure entryways by restricting and regulating access to a particular space or property.
Usually placed outside of the building's main entrance, as well as inside of the building on server room doors, network closets, and other areas.

Padlocks use a pin and tumbler system that is fairly easy to defeat.
More complex types of door locks are available.
Wireless signals are another commonly used technology in modern door locks.

Another commonly used technology are biometric locks like facial recognition scans or fingerprint identification scans. (Inherence Factor)
> The third factor of authentication (something you are, defined by biometrics) is thee strongest individual authentications factor. Biometric methods include fingerprint recognition, vein pattern matching, retinal and iris scans, facial recognition, voice recognition, and gait analysis.
# Biometrics
## False Acceptance Rate (FAR)
The rate that the system authenticates a user as valid, even though that person should not have been granted access to the system. The more sensitive the system is the less FAR is.
## False Rejection Rate (FRR)
Occurs any time the biometrics system denies a user who should been allowed access to the system. The more sensitive the system is the more FRR is.
## Equal Error Rate (EER)
More commonly called Crossover Error Rate (CER), which uses a measure of effectiveness of a given biometrics system to achieve balance.

> Iris and retina scans are the strongest biometrics methods. Iris scans are commonly preferred over retinal scans because retinal scans are intrusive and may reveal private medical concerns. Facial recognition and gait analysis can bypass the enrollment process when used for identification instead of authorization.


# Cipher Lock
Provides excellent protection using a mechanical locking mechanism with push buttons that are numbered and require a person to enter the correct combination in order to open that door.
