Simulated cyber attack that helps in the assessment of computer systems for exploitable vulnerabilities.
## Physical Pentesting
Testing an organizations's physical security through testing locks, access cards, security cameras, and other protective measures.

A physical pentest aims to find weaknesses in an organization's physical security and suggest enhancements to bolster it.
- Identify physical vulnerabilities
- Improve security awareness
- Prevent unauthorized access
## Offensive Pentesting (Red Teaming)
Proactive approach that involves use of attack techniques, akin to real cyber threats, that seek and exploit system vulnerabilities.
Offensive pentesting simulates real-world attacks so the organization learn to recognize and defend against such threats.
## Defensive Pentesting (Blue Teaming)
Reactive approach that entails fortifying systems, identifying and addressing attacks, and enhancing incident response times.
- Improve incident response time
- Strengthen systems
- Enhance detection capabilities
## Integrated Pentesting (Purple Teaming)
Combination of aspects of both offensive and defensive testing into a single penetration test. Also covers multiple security domains from physical infrastructure to software applications and network configurations.
