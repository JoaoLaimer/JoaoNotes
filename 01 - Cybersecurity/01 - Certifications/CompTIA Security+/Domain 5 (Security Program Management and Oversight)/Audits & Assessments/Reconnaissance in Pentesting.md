## Reconnaissance
An initial phase where critical information about a target system is gathered to enhance an attack's effectiveness and success.
Crucial step in penetration testing.
### Active Reconnaissance
Direct engagement with the target system, offering more information but with a higher detection risk.
### Passive Reconnaissance
Gathering information without direct engagement with the target system, offering lower detection risk but less data.

Reconnaissance necessity and extent depend on the test type and environment.
### Known Environment
Detailed target infrastructure information from the organization is received prior to the test.
- Focuses on known assets
- Evaluates vulnerabilities and weaknesses
- Aims to understand exploitability and potential damages
- Resembles an internal thread scenario
## Partially Known Environment
Involves limited information provided to testers, who may have partial knowledge of the system.
Partially known environment testing aims to identify vulnerabilities in both known and hidden assets.
## Unknown Environment
Testers receive minimal to no information about the target system.
Unknown environment testing aims to mimic an external attacker with limited knowledge.
