Objective and numerical evaluation of risks

Method of evaluating risk that uses numerical measurements.

## Exposure Factor (EF)
Proportion of an asset that is lost in an event.
Expressed as a percentage.
## Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
Monetary value expected to be lost in a single event.
Calculated by: 
$$AV \times EF = SLE$$
## Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
Estimated frequency with which a threat is expected to occur within a year.
## Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
Expected annual loss from a risk.
$$ SLE \times ARO = ALE $$
Example:
Asset Value = 10.000
Exposure Factor = 50%
$$ SLE = \$10.000 \times 50\% = \$5.000$$
SLE = 5.000
ARO = 0.5
$$ ALE = \$5.000 \times 0.5 = \$2.500 $$
## ALE Modified (ALEm) Mitigation Rate
Estimated rate of occurrences that are mitigated.
## Return on Security Investment (ROSI)
$$ ROSI = \frac{(ALE \times ALEm) - Cost\ of\ Solution}{Cost\ of\ Solution} $$
This will give the percentage of the return.
