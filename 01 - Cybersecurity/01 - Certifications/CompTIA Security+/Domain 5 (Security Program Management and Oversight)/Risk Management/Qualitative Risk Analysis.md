A method of assessing risks based on their potential impact and the likelihood of their occurrence.

This method is subjective and relies on the expertise and experience of the project team and stakeholders.

Likelihood and probability refer to the chance of a particular risk occurring.

The impact refers to the potential consequences if the risk materializes.

The project manager, using Qualitative Risk Analysis, might prioritize this risk and develop mitigation strategies.
