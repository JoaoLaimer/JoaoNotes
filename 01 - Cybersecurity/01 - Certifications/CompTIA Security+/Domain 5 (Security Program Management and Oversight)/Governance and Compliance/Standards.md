Provide a framework for implementing security measures, ensuring that all aspects of an organization's security posture are addressed.
## Password Standards
Dictate the complexity and management of passwords, which are the first line of defense against unauthorized access.
- Minimum lenght of 8-12 characters
- Mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
- Number
- Special Characters
## Access Control Standards
Determine who has access to what resources within an organization
### Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
Allows the order of the information or resource to decide who can access it.
### Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
Uses labels or classifications to determine access, often used in government or military settings.
## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Assigns access based on roles within an organization, ensuring that users only have access to the resources necessary for their job function.

These standards might also cover the principles of least privilege and separation of duties.

## Physical Security Standards
These standards cover the physical measures taken to protect an organization's assets and information.
It also covers environmental control such as fire suppression system, HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) controls, and power redundancy systems.
## Encryption Standards
Ensure that data intercepted or accessed without authorization remains unreadable and secure.
The choice of encryption standard often depends on the specific use case and the balance between security and performance.

## ISO Standards
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an independent organization that establishes standards.
- **ISO 27001**: "Information Security Management Systems", provide information on information security management systems (ISMS) requirements. It's a three-stage certification process.
- **ISO 27002**: "Information Security, Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection - Information Security Controls", is a complement to ISO 27001. While ISO 27001 identifies the requirements to become certified, ISO 27002 provides organization with the best practices guidance.
- **ISO 27701**: "Privacy Information Management Systems (PIMS)", is a extension to ISO 27001/2, and it outlines a framework for managing PII, and compliance with global standards like the GDPR.
- **ISO 31000**: "Risk Management", is a family of standards related to risk management.
## NIST Framework
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publishes two important frameworks that are widely used by risk management and cybersecurity professionals.

**NIST Risk Management Framework (NIST SP 800-37)**: "Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organization", covers the Risk Management Framework (RMF), with seven-steps:
1. **Prepare**: organizations identifies key roles for implementing the framework, identifies risk tolerance strategies and in-place controls.
2. **Categorize**: Personnel determine the adverse impact to operations and assets if there is a loss of confidentiality, integrity, availability.
3. **Select**: Personnel select and tailor the controls necessary to protect their operations and assets.
4. **Implement**: Personnel implement the selected controls.
5. **Assess**: Assess the controls to see if they are producing the desired outcome.
6. **Authorize**: A senior management official determines if the system is authorized to operate.
7. **Monitor**: Constant assessment of changes in the system and environment.

**NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**: Aligns with the RMF. Allows organization to improve their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks.
1. **Core**: is a set of activities an organization select to achieve desired outcomes. It includes five functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover.
2. **Tiers**: The tiers help and organization identify how it views risk. Partial (Tier 1), Risk Informed (Tier 2), Repeatable (Tier 3), and Adaptive (Tier 4). The highest tier indicates the organization has a mature risk management program.
3. **Profile**: Provide a list of outcomes for an organization based on its needs and risk assessments.
