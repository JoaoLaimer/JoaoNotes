Security flaws or weaknesses inherent in a device's physical components or design that can be exploited to compromise the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of the system and its data.
## Firmware
Specialized form of software stored on hardware device, like a router or a smart thermostat, that provides low-level control for the device's specific hardware.
- Without security
- Outdated security
Mitigate:
- Regular updates
- Security auditing
- Device hardening
## End-of-life Systems
Refer to hardware of software products that have reached the end of their life cycle.
### Legacy Systems
Outdated computing software, hardware, or technologies that have been largely superseded by newer and more efficient alternatives.
## Unsupported Systems
Hardware or software products that no longer receive official technical support, security updates, or patches from their respective vendors or developers.
## Unpatched Systems
Device, application, or piece of software that has not been updated with the latest security patches so that ir remains vulnerable to known exploits and attacks.
- Unauthorized Access
- Data Compromise
- Service Disruption
## Hardware Misconfiguration
Occurs when a device's settings, parameters, or options are not optimally set up, and this can cause vulnerabilities to exist, a decrease in performance, or unintended behavior of devices or systems.
- Conduct regular audits
- Enforce good configuration management practices
- Implement automated tools
- Provide training to personal.
## Mitigations
### Hardening
Involves tightening the security of a system.
### Patching
Involves the regular updating of the software, firmware and application with the latest security patches.
### Configuration Enforcement
Used to ensure that all devices and system adhere to a standard secure configuration.
### Decommissioning
Means that the system is retired and removed from the network
### Isolation
Used to limit the potential damage that might occur from a potential security breach.
### Segmentation
Used to divide the network into segments.
