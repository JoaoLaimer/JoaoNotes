### Hardware Manufacturing
Hardware is composed from thousands of components, those components are sourced from from various suppliers, and they can each be a potential vulnerability.
Purchase of additional hardware from secondary or aftermarket sources can introduce risk.

## Software Developers
Software developers and software providers are integral cogs in the supply chains, and any software has to be checked to ensure it's licensed, authentic, and bug free. Software should be scanned with antivirus.

## Managed Service Providers
Organizations that provide a range of technology services and support to businesses and other clients.
- Evaluate data security measures
- Ensure confidentiality and integrity
- Assess cyber security protocols
- Response to the security breach

You are only as strong as the weakest link in that supply chain.
