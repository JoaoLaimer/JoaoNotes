Piece of malicious software, much like a virus, but it can replicate itself without any user interaction.
1. Can infect the workstation and other computing assets.
2. Can cause disruption to the normal network traffic since they are constantly trying to replicate and spread across the network.
Best known for spreading far and wide over the internet in a relatively short amount of time.

**Conficker** is one of the largest worms, because it was able to infect between 9 and 15 million machines.
