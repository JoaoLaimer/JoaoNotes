Type of malicious software that is designed to block access to a computer system or its data by encrypting it until a ransom is paid to the attackers.
## How can we protect ourselves
1. Backup all of important data, files and systems
2. Update all of the software, especially operating system and antivirus program
3. Provide security awareness training to the end user
4. Enable multi-factor authentication to provide an extra layer of security.

# **Never pay the ransom**
# Disconnect the Infected System from the Network
# Notify the Authorities
# Restore the Data from Known Good Backups
