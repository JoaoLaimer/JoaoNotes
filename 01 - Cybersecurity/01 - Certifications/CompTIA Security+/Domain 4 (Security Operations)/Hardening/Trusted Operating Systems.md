## Trusted Operating System (TOS)
Designed to provide a secure computing environment by enforcing stringent security policies that usually rely on mandatory access controls.
## Integrity-178B
POSIX-based operating system that is designed for embedded system use.
## Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 6
Based on  set of predefined security standard and certification from the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation.
**EAL 1**: Lowest level of assurance
**EAL 7**: Highest level of assurance.

## Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
Access permissions are determined by a policy defined by the system administrators and enforced by the operating system.
## SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux)
Set of controls that are installed on top of another Linux distributions.
## Trusted Solaris
Offers secure, multi-level operations with MAC, detailed system audits, and data/process compartmentalization.

> Trusted Os enhances security with microkernels by minimizing the trusted base and reducing attack surface and vulnerabilities.

Most common operating systems like Windows, MacOS, and Linux has been rated as EAL4 or EAL4+, meaning, the OS was carefully designed, tested, and reviewed, offering good security assurance.
