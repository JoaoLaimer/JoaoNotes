Planning, testing, implementing, and auditing of software patches.
## Planning
Creating policies, procedures, an systems to track and verify patch compatibility.
A good patch management tool confirms patch deployment, installation, and functional verification on servers or clients.
## Testing
Test the patches we receive from the manufacturer before pushing it in production systems.
## Implementation
After testing and making sure the new update works properly in the lab environment, we can now push on production systems.
Large corporations should use a central update server instead of Windows Update.
## Patch Rings
Deploying patches on increasing groups of machines.
