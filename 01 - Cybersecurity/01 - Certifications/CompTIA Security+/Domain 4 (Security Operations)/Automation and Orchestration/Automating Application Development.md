Automation involves the use of technology to manage, test, and, deploy new apps or features with minimal human intervention.
## Continuous Integration (CI)
Practice in software development where developers merge code changes frequently in one place
> Continuous integration promotes the seamless collaboration of security teams and developers by integrating code changes regularly into a shared repository. This practice helps in identifying and addressing security issues early in the development process, ensuring that security is prioritized throughout the software development lifecycle
- Increase software quality
- Automates testing of code
- Detection of issues earlier

## Release 
Process of finalizing and preparing new software or updates.
## Deployment 
Involves automated process of software releases to users.
## Continuous Delivery
Maintain deployable code with automation.
Part of the release process.
The full deployment process is automated only up to a certain stage.
## Continuous Deployment
Automates the process of deploying code changes from testing to production after completion of the build stage.
Rollback capability is crucial for ensuring service continuity in a continuous deployment model.
