#### User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)
Built upon the foundation of UBA with monitoring of entities as an additional function.
UBA aims to spot anomalies in established patterns, indicating potential threats.
1. Collect and analyzed data from diverse sources 
2. Employ advanced analytics methods
3. Create a baseline for normal user behavior
4. Continuously monitor user activity to detect anomalies

UBA tools have benefits.
1. Early detection of threats.
2. Insider threats detection.
3. Improved incident response.
