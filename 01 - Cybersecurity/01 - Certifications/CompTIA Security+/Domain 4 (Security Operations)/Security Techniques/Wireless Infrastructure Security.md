Good placement for wireless access points:
- Range
- Coverage
- Signal Strength
Access point placement is a huge concern in terms of the security of the wireless network.
Place the wireless access points near the center of the facility to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
Always  place the access points in a higher location.
## Extended Service Set (ESS) configuration
Involves multiple wireless access point working together to create a unified and extended coverage area for users in a large building or facility.

Interference:
- Co-Channel: two AP using the same channel, causing retransmission of data.
- Adjacent Channel: when adjacent channels do not have enough space between them.
Always select Channels 1, 6, and 11 when operating in the 2.4 GHz wireless frequency band.
## Site Survey
Process of planning and designing a wireless network to provide a solution.
