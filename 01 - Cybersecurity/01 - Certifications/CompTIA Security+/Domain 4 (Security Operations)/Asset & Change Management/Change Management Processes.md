There are areas to be considered throughout the change management process
1. Use of scheduled maintenance windows.
	A scheduled maintenance window does not restrict change implementation as emergencies may require immediate action
2. Creation of a backout plan.
	Predetermined strategy for restoring systems to their initial state in case a change does not go as expected.
3. Testing of results.
4. Use of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
