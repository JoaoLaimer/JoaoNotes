## Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
Permits employees to use personal devices for work.
In BYOD, employees own and control the security of their devices.
1. Personal devices must undergo security checks and have specific software for protecting company data.
2. Organization might not have the ability to manage or update the device for users, o enforce stricter security configurations.
## Corporate-Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE)
Involves the company providing a mobile device to employees for both work and personal use.

Cope standardizes device management but may be expensive for employers providing devices to staff

## Choose Your Own Device (CYOD)
Offers a middle ground between BYOD and COPE by allowing employees to choose devices from a company-approved list.
CYOD has higher initial costs for the organization and raises employee data privacy concerns.
## Considerations
- Costs
- Security
- Employee satisfaction
BYOD is cost-effective, but hidden costs may arise related to security an compatibility
COPE and CYOD have higher upfront costs but save on ongoing support due to fewer supported device models
CYOD provides optimal control over devices and enables management through the organizations's MDM solution.
BYOD and CYOD models are suitable or prioritizing employee's freedom and choice.
