Documenting changes provides a clear history of the what, when and why for accountability for future reference.
1. Version Control
	Tracks and manages changes in documents and software, enabling collaborative work and reverting to prior version when needed.
	Version control ensures continuity and stability in the environment beyond preserving history
2.  Proper Documentation
	- Properly document and record every change
	- Update diagrams
	- Revise policies and procedures
	- Update change requests
	- Maintain associated trouble tickets
	Updating diagrams, like flowcharts or network diagrams, offers a visual snapshot of the system's architecture.

## Review and Maintenance of Records
When encountering implementation issues, revise policies and procedures to prevent future occurrences
After implementing a change, update the related change request or trouble ticket to indicate completion.
