## Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS)
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) maintain the Automated Indicator Sharing site www.cisa.gov/ais used for the real-time exchange of threat indicators and defensive measures. AIS uses both TAXII and STIX
## File/code Repositories
Many repositories include prewritten code that developers can use for a variety of purposes, including gathering intelligence.
## Threat Maps
Threat maps provide a visual representation of active threats.
