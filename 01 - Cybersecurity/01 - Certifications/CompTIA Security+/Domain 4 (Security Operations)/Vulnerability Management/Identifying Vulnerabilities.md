Systematic practice of spotting and categorizing weaknesses in a system, network, or application that could potentially be exploited.
## Vulnerability Scanning 
Automated method of probing networks, systems, and applications to discover potential vulnerabilities.
- Nessus 
- OpenVAS
**Credentialed Scan**: with the privileges of an administrator account.
**Non-Credentialed Scan**

## Application Security Techniques
Used to safeguard the software from being manipulated during its lifecycle.
### Static Analysis
Used to analyze an application's source code without executing it.
- Manual Review
- Automated Tools
### Dynamic Analysis
Evaluates an application as it is being run to determine if there are any vulnerabilities in the application.
- OWASP ZAP
- Burp Suite
- Peach Fuzzer
### Package Monitoring
Ensures that the libraries and components that the application depends on are secure and up-to-date.
- Snyk
- Dependabot
## Penetration Testing
Used to simulate a real-world attack on a system to evaluate its security posture.
## System and Process Audits
Process that involves conducting a comprehensive review of the information systems, security policies, and procedures.
1. Planning: Plan to track vulnerabilities and deploy fixes
2. Testing: Test patches and updates in a controlled environment
3. Implementing: Implement patches across devices and applications
4. Auditing: Audit to verify effective patch implementation and check for post-implementation issues
