Confirmation, Prioritization, Classification, Organizational Impact, Exposure Factor, Risk Tolerance.
- True Positive: True vulnerability.
- False Positive: A non-vulnerability detected as a vulnerability.
- True Negative: When there is no vulnerabilities on the system.
- **False Negative**: When a vulnerability that exists on the system is not detected.
## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
System that provides a standardized way to uniquely identify and reference known vulnerabilities in software and hardware.
CVEs help assess security and prioritize vulnerability fixes.
## Exposure Factor (EF)
Used as a quantifiable metric to help a cybersecurity professional understand the exact percentage of an asset that is likely to be damaged or affected if a particular vulnerability is exploited.
Organizations must grasp exposure factors for effective qualitative risk management.
- Time
- Money
- Resources
## Risk Tolerance
Refers to the level of risk that an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives and before action is deemed necessary to mitigate the risk.
Aligning vulnerability management with risk tolerance ensures security stays in line with business strategies.
