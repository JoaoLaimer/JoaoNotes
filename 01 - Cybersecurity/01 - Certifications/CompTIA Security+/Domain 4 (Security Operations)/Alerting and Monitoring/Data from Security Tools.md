## SIEM
The central hub for the consolidation to provide a holistic view of an organization's security landscape.
## Antivirus Software
Fundamental security tool that protects systems against malware, including viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware.
## Data Loss Prevention Systems
Used to monitor and control data endpoints, network traffic and data stored in the clod to prevent potential data breaches from occurring.
## Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)
Monitors activity on the network. An admin installs NIDS **sensors** or collectors on network devices such as switches routers, or firewalls. These sensor gather information and report to a central monitoring network appliance hosting a NIDS console.
> Sensors usually are connected to a port tap or port mirror (port spanning) on internal switches.

### Detection Methods
#### Signature Based
Sometimes called definition-based, use a database of known vulnerabilities or known attack patterns.
#### Trend Based
Sometimes called anomaly-based, compares normal network operations to abnormal activity.
> Can be effective at **discovering zero-day** exploits
#### Rule Based
Predefined rules generates the alerts.
## Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS)
An NIPS is installed in-line with the traffic and can detect, react to, and prevent attacks.
> An IDS monitors and respond to an attack. It is not in-line but instead collects data passively (also known as out-of-band).

## Firewalls
Serve as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network.
## Vulnerability Scanners
Tool that identify security weaknesses in a system, including missing patches, incorrect configurations, and other types of known vulnerabilities.
