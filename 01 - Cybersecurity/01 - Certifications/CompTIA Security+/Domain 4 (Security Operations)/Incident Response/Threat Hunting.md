Cybersecurity method for finding hidden threats not caught by regular security monitoring.
Allows the identifying and mitigating of security threats before they cause damage.

> Proactive approach to identifying and mitigating security threats

**Establish a Hypothesis**: Predicting high-impact, likely events through threat modeling.
- Who might want to harm us?
- Who might want to break into our networks?
- How might they be able to do that?
**Profiling Threat Actors and Activities**: Envisioning how potential attackers might intrude and what they aim to achieve.
- What TTPs might they use?
- Who wants to harm us?
- Are they insider threat, a hacktivist, a criminal organizations, or a nation-state APT?
Analyze the logs and data on processes, file systems, and server changes to gather information.
In threat hunting, it starts by assuming that the current rules haven't flagged potential threats.
- Seek undetected issues.
- Focus what bypasses existing rules.
- Explore cases where queries do not yield expected data.
