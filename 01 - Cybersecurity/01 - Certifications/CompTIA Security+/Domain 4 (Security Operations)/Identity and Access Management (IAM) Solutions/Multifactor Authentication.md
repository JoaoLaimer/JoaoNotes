**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
Security system that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credential to verify the user's identity.
## Knowledge-based Factor
"Something you know"
Information that the user must provide to authenticate their identity
## Possession-based Factor
"Something you have"
Something the user physically posses like a smart card, a hardware token or a software token with a smartphone.
A software token does the same job as a hard token without needing specific hardware.
Authenticator apps are used to generate time-based, one-time passcodes.

> Smart cards are often used with two-factor authentication where users have something (the smart card) and know something (such as a password or PIN). Smart cards include embedded certificates used with digital signatures and encryption. They are used to gain access to secure locations and to log on to computer systems.

> HOTP and TOTP are open-source standards used to create one-time-use passwords. HOTP creates a one-time-use passwords. that does not expire until it is used, and TOTP creates a one-time password that expires after 30-60 seconds. Both can be used as software tokens for authentication.
## Inherence-based Factor
"Something you are"
Involves biometric characteristics that are unique to individuals, including fingerprints, facial recognition, voice recognition, or iris scans.
## Location-based Factor
"Somewhere you are"
Involves determining a user's location to help authenticate them.
## Behaviour-based Factor
"Something you do"
Recognizing patterns that are typically associated with a user, such as their keystroke patterns, mouse movements, or even the way a user walks down the hallway.
## Single-factor Authentication
Using a single authentication factor access a user account.
## Two-factor Authentication (2FA)
Using two different authentication factors to gain access to a system.
## Multifactor Authentication
Using two or more factors to authenticate with a given system.

> Using two or more methods in the same factor of authentication (such as PIN and a password) is a single-factor authetication. Two-factor authentication uses two different authentication factors, such as using a hardware toekn and PIN.
## Passkeys 
Users can create and access online accounts without needing to input a password.
When logging in, users unlock their device using their chosen authentication, such as a facial scan or fingerprint.

> Passwordless authentication is not necessarily multifactor authentication. You can use a single something you have or something you are factor to use passwordless authentication.
