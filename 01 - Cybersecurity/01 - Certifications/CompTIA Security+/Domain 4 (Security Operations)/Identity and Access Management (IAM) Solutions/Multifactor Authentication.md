**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
Security system that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credential to verify the user's identity.
## Knowledge-based Factor
"Something you know"
Information that the user must provide to authenticate their identity
## Possession-based Factor
"Something you have"
Something the user physically posses like a smart card, a hardware token or a software token with a smartphone.
A software token does the same job as a hard token without needing specific hardware.
Authenticator apps are used to generate time-based, one-time passcodes.
## Inherence-based Factor
"Something you are"
Involves biometric characteristics that are unique to individuals, including fingerprints, facial recognition, voice recognition, or iris scans.
## Location-based Factor
"Somewhere you are"
Involves determining a user's location to help authenticate them.
## Behaviour-based Factor
"Something you do"
Recognizing patterns that are typically associated with a user, such as their keystroke patterns, mouse movements, or even the way a user walks down the hallway.
## Single-factor Authentication
Using a single authentication factor access a user account.
## Two-factor Authentication (2FA)
Using two different authentication factors to gain access to a system.
## Multifactor Authentication
Using two or more factors to authenticate with a given system.
## Passkeys 
Users can create and access online accounts without needing to input a password.
When logging in, users unlock their device using their chosen authentication, such as a facial scan or fingerprint.
