## Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
Employs security labels to authorize user access to specific resources.
In MAC, if not explicitly allowed, it's considered forbidden for users.
## Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
Resource's owner determines which users can access each resource.
## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Assign users to roles and uses these roles to grant permissions to resources.
Role-based access control enforces minimum privileges.
## Rule-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Enables administrators to apply security policies to all users.
## Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC)
Uses object characteristics for access control decisions.
**User Attributes**: User's name, role, organization, ID, or security clearance level.
**Environment Attributes**: Time of access, data location, and current organization's threat level.
**Resource Attributes**: File creation date, resource owner, file name, and data sensitivity.
## Time of Day Restrictions
Controls restrict resource access based on request times.
## Principle of Least Privilege
Granting users the minimum access required for their tasks without extra privileges.
Least privilege reduces the risk of an account being misused if compromised by an threat actor.
Least privilege requires continually reviewing user permissions to prevent permission creep.
## Permission or Authorization Creep
Occurs when a user gains excessive rights during their career progression in the company.
