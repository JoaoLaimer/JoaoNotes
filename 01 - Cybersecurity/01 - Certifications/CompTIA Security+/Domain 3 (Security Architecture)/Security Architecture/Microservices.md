A software architecture where large applications are broken down into smaller and independent services.
Unlike in monolithic architecture, each service in microservice architecture is self-continued and able to run independently.
Pros:
- Scalability
- Flexibility
- Resilience
- Faster Deployment and Updates
Cons:
- Complexity
- Data Management
- Network Latency
- Security
