## Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
Control systems used to monitor and control industrial processes ranging from simples systems to complex systems.
- **Distributed Control Systems (DCS)**: Manages process automation within a single site
- **Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)**: Are embedded devices within ICSs connecting to actuators and sensors.
- **Human-Machine Interface (HMIs)**: Allows operators to interact directly with the system
## Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
A type of ICS used to monitor and control geographically dispersed industrial processes.
- Electric power generation, transmission, and distribution systems.
- Water treatment and distribution systems.
- Oil and gas pipeline monitoring and control systems.
