Specialized computing component designed to perform dedicated functions within a large structure.
## Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)
Ensures data processing in real-time and is crucial for time-sensitive applications.

## Vulnerabilities
- Hardware Failure
- Software Bugs
- Security Vulnerabilities
- Outdated Systems
> RTOSs prioritize performance, sometimes at the expense of security features like buffer overflow protections, potentially leaving the system susceptible to certain attacks.

## Securing Embedded Systems
### Network Segmentation
Divides a network into multiple segments or subnets, limiting potential damage in case of a breach.
### Wrappers
Show only the entry and exit points of the data when travelling between networks. 
- IPSec
### Firmware Code Control
This can be achieved thorough secure coding practices, code reviews, and automated testing
## Inability to Patch
Strategies like over-the-air (OTA) updates, where patches are delivered and installed remotely, can be applied.
