## Virtualization
Technology that allows the emulation of servers.

## Hypervisors
### Type 1
Known a a bare metal, it runs directly on the host hardware and functions similarly to an operating system.
### Type 2
Operates within  standard operating system, such as Windows, Mac, or Linux.

Type 1 hypervisor is faster and efficient than a type 2 hypervisor.

## Containerization
Lightweight alternative to full machine virtualization.
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Red Hat OpenShift
## VM Escape
Virtual machines are segmented and separated by default.
Occurs when an attacker is able to break out of one of these normally isolated virtual machines.
## Privilege Elevation
Occurs when a user is able to gain the ability to run functions as a higher level user.
## Live Migration of virtual Machines
When a virtual machine needs to move from one physical host to another.
## Resource reuse
Concept in computing where system resources like memory or processing power are reused.
## Securing 
- Update the Operating System in the Application
- Ensure that Each virtual machine has a Good Antivirus solution installed
- Good strong password and good policies
- Update hypervisors
- Limit the connections between VMs and physical machines.
- Minimize and Remove Unused Features.
