## Virtualization
Technology that allows the emulation of servers.
## Hypervisors
### Type 1
Known a a bare metal, it runs directly on the host hardware and functions similarly to an operating system.
### Type 2
Operates within  standard operating system, such as Windows, Mac, or Linux.

Type 1 hypervisor is faster and efficient than a type 2 hypervisor.
## Containerization
Lightweight alternative to full machine virtualization.
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Red Hat OpenShift

## Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
Hosts a user's desktop operating system on a server.
## Thin Client
Is a computer with enough resources to boot and connect to a server to run specific applications and desktops.
## VM Escape
Virtual machines are segmented and separated by default.
Occurs when an attacker is able to break out of one of these normally isolated virtual machines.
## Privilege Elevation
Occurs when a user is able to gain the ability to run functions as a higher level user.
## Live Migration of virtual Machines
When a virtual machine needs to move from one physical host to another.
## Resource reuse
Concept in computing where system resources like memory or processing power are reused.
## VM Sprawl Avoidance
VM sprawl occurs when an organization has many VMs that aren't appropriately managed.
## Replication
Makes it easy to restore a failed virtual server. If you create a backup of the virtual server files and the original server fails, you simply restore the files.
## Snapshots
A snapshots provides you with a copy of a VM at the moment in time, which you can use as backup. Commonly took prior to risky changes.
## Securing 
- Update the Operating System in the Application
- Ensure that Each virtual machine has a Good Antivirus solution installed
- Good strong password and good policies
- Update hypervisors
- Limit the connections between VMs and physical machines.
- Minimize and Remove Unused Features.
