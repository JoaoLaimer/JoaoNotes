## Physical Separation / Air Gapping
Isolation of a network by removing any direct or indirect connections from other networks.

Physical separation is one the most secure methods of security but it is still vulnerable to sophisticated attacks.
## Logical Separation
Creates boundaries within a network, restricting access to certain areas.
- VLANs
- Firewalls
> VLANs separate or segment traffic on physical networks, and you can create multiple VLANs with a single switch. A VLAN can logically group several different computers together or logically separate computers without regard to their physical location.
## Implicit Trust Zones
Implicit trust zones are areas within a network where communication is allowed without exhaustive security checks.

# Security Zones
- **Intranet**: Is an internal network. People use the intranet to communicate and share content with each other. While it's common for an intranet to include internal web servers, this isn't a requirement.
- **Extranet**: is a part of a network that can be accessed by authorized entities from outside of the network.
