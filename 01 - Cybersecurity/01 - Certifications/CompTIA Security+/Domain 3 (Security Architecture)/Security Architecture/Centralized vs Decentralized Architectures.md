## Centralized 
All the computing functions are coordinated and managed from a single location or authority.
- Efficiency and Control
- Consistency
- Cost and Effectiveness
There are risks involved in centralized architectures:
- Single Point of Failure
- Scalability Issues
- Security Risks
## Decentralized
Computing function are distributed across multiple systems or locations.
- Resiliency
- Scalability
- Flexibility
Risks:
- Security Risks
- Management Challenges
- Data Inconsistency
