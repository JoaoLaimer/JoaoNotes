## Shared Physical Server Vulnerabilities
Can lead to vulnerabilities if one user's data is compromised.
## Inadequate Virtual Environment Security
Can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents.
- Using Secure VM Templates
- Regularly Updating and Patching VMs
- Monitoring VMs for Unusual Activities
## User Access management
Can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems.
- Enforcing Strong Password Policies
- Using Multi-Factor Authentication
- Limiting User Permissions Based on the Principle of Least Privilege
- Monitoring User Activities for any Suspicious Behavior
## Lack of Up-to-date Security Measures
Can lead to leaving the systems vulnerable to new threats.
- Keeping Software and Systems Patched
- Regularly Reviewing and Updating Security Policies
- Staying Informed About the Latest threats and Security Best Practices
## Single Points of Failure
Can lead to a complete system outage affecting all users. Using multiple:
- Server
- Data Center
- Cloud Providers
## Weak Authentication and Encryption Practices
Can lead to allowing unauthorized users to gain access to cloud systems.
- Multi-Factor Authentication
- Strong Encryption Algorithms
- Secure Key Management Practices
## Unclear Policies
Lack of clear guidelines or procedures for various security aspects.
## Data Remnants 
Residual data left behind after deletion or erasure processes.
- Using Secure Deletion Methods that Overwrite Data
- Managing Backups Securily
- Verifying that data has been completely removed after deletion.
