## Correct Placement of Devices
- Routers
- Switches
- Access Points
Proper placement should achieve:
- Optimal data flow
- Minimized latency
- Robust defense
Unproper placement can cause:
- Network bottlenecks
- Vulnerability points
- Areas without connectivity
## Security Zone
Distinct segment within a network often created by logically isolating the segment using a firewall or other security device.
- Public-facing services
- Internal employee resources
- Sensitive data storage
Remember the term screened subnet
## Screened Subnet
Hosts public-facing services such as web servers, email servers, and DNS servers and safeguards against security breaches by preventing attackers from gaining direct access to the sensitive core internal network.
## Attack Surface of a Network
Refers to all the points where an unauthorized users can try to enter data or extract data from an environment.
- Improper device placement
- Improperly configured devices 
- Outdated software
- Unnecessary open ports
- Weak access controls
## Connectivity
Refers to how different components of a network communicate with each other and with other external networks.
- Wi-Fi
- Microwave Links
- Satellite Connections
Filter optics excel in speed, reliability, and signal quality for robust connectivity.
Considerations:
- Scalability
- Speed requirements
- Security considerations
- Budgetary constraints
## Devices Attributes
- Active
- Passive
**Inline**: An inline  device sits in the network traffic path, and is able to control or block traffic as it passes through this device;
- Firewall
- Router
- IPS
**Tap-Based Configuration**: Taps and monitors operate discreetly outside the network path, capturing data for analysis without impacting traffic.
- Health
- Performance
- Security
## Failure Mode
- **Fail-open**: allows all traffic in the event of a failure.
- **Fail-closed**: blocks all traffic in the event of a failure.
