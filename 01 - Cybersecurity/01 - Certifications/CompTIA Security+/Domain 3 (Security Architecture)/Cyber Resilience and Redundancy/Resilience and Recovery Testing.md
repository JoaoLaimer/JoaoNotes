## Recovery Testing
Evaluates the system's ability to return to regular functioning following a disruptive incident.
Resilience and recovery testing serves as "fire drills" for enterprise networks and operations.
## Tabletop Exercise
A simulated discussion to improve crisis readiness without deploying resources.

Tabletop exercises promote team-building and identify gaps in response plans.
## Failover Test
Verifies seamless system transition to a backup for uninterrupted functionality during disasters.
Failover tests require more resources, time, and energy but verify planned actions will work.
## Simulation
Computer-generated representation of real-world scenarios.
Simulations allow responders to perform actions in a virtualized environment.
## Parallel Processing 
Replicates data an processes onto a secondary system, running both in parallel.
Parallel processing aims to check the reliability and stability of the secondary setup.
- **In resilience testing**, tests ability to handle multiple failure scenarios.
- **In recovery testing** tests efficiency to recover from multiple failure points.
