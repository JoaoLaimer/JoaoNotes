The ability of a service to be continuously available by minimizing the downtime to the lowest amount possible
## Uptime
The number of minutes or hours that the system remains online over a given period, and this uptime is usually expressed as a percentage.

99.9999% equate to only 31 seconds of downtime each and every year.
## Load Balancing 
The process of distributing workloads across multiple computing resources.
## Clustering
The use of multiple computers, multiple storage devices, and redundant network connections that all work together as a single system to provide high levels of availability, reliability, and scalability.
Clustering provides redundancy in the event of system failure to ensure that continuity of service is maintained.
## Redundancy
The duplication of critical components or functions of a system with intention of increasing the reliability of the system.
- Adding multiple power supplies
	This type of power supply redundancy can be achieved by installing two power supply units inside of a server or network device.
- Network connections
	Maintain multiple network connections or pathways by using multiple cabled connections.
- Servers
	Servers and services can be configured to operate in a load balanced or clustered architecture.
- Software services
- Service providers
	To safeguard the organization against outages, use two or more service providers to ensure a constant backup

Utilize multi-cloud systems to distribute data, applications, and services across several different cloud-based environments.
Using multi-cloud system also provides soem additional flexibility for scaling operations and for optimizing costs.
