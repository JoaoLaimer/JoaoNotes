## Power Events
### Surge
A small and unexpected increase in the amount of voltage that is being provided.
### Spike
A short transient voltage that is usually caused by a short circuit, a tripped circuit breaker, a power outage, or a lightning strike.
### Sag
A small and unexpected decrease in the amount of voltage that is being provided.
It is common to see sags that drop voltage from 120 volts to 117 or 115 volts instead.
### Undervoltage Event (Brownout)
Occurs when the voltage is reduced to lower levels and usually occur for a longer period of time.
### Power Loss Event (Blackout)
Occurs when there is a total loss of power for a given period of time.
With a complete power loss event, it is important to be aware that when power is restored it can also caus a power spike
## Equipment
### Line Conditioners
Used to overcome any minor fluctuations in the power being received by the given system
Automatically adjust the power signal being received as an undervoltage or overvoltage condition and change it back to the standard power level.
### Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)
A device that provides emergency power to a system when the normal input power source has failed.
### Generator 
Machine that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy for use in an external circuit through the process of electromagnetic induction
- Portable gas-engine
- Permanently Installed
- Battery-Inverter
### Power Distribution Center (PDC)
Acts as a central hub where power is received and then distributed to all systems in the data center.
Most large data centers will use a rack mounted uninterrupted power supply to provide line conditioning and battery backup
The data center should use power distributions units for line conditioning and load balancing from the main utility power source to each server rack.
