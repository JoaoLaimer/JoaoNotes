## Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
Addresses responses to disruptive events
## Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
Considered as a subset of BC plan, it focuses on how to resume operation swiftly after a disaster.

A BCP will be used for any disruptive event or any kind of response to a given threat.
A BCP involves preventive actions and recovery steps for various threats, not limited to technical disruptions.

DRP focuses on how to resume operations after a disaster.
BCP and DRP differ only in the type of event to respond to:
- BCP: incident
- DRP: disaster
Senior management takes charge of BCP/DRP development. A Business Continuity Coordinator is appointed to lead the Business Continuity Committee.
A Business Continuity Committee should include representatives from different departments to address the scope of planning.
BCP/DRP covers everything in the business so the committee must comprise people from across the organization.

- Define the scope of the BCP/DRP to prevent scope creep
- Consider the organization's risk appetite and tolerance
- Structure the BCP/DRP by business function or geographical area.
