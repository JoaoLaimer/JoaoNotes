The process of creating duplicate copies of digital information to protect against data loss, corruption, or unavailability.
Never keep all the data on a single device or server.
## Incremental Backups
Capture all the changes made since the last backup.
## Continuous Backups
Allow near-instantaneous backup of changed data, ensuring minimal data loss during failures.
## Differential Backups
Save data changed since the last full backup.
## Onsite or Offsite Backup
Where the backups of the data are physically being stored.
It's important to remember that the backed up data might be vulnerable to destruction.
### Offsite Backup
The practice of storing duplicate copies of data a geographically separate location from the primary data source to provide protection gains physical disasters and to ensure data continuity.
### Onsite Backup

## Frequency
How much data is the company willing to lose?
Consider the RPO (Recovery Point Objective) of the organization to confirm that the backup plan preserves the necessary data amount.
Another consideration is how frequently the data will be changed inside of the business.
## Encryption on Backups
Fundamental safeguard that protects the backup data from unauthorized access and potential breaches.
- Data-at-rest Ecnryption
- Data-in-transit Encryption
## Snapshots
Point-in-time copies of the data the capture a consistent state that is essentially a frozen in time copy of the data.
## Recovery
Used to regain access to the data in the event of a data loss or a system failure.
- Selection of backup
- Initiating the recovery process
- Data Validation
- Testing and validation
- Documentation and reporting
- Notification
## Replication
Making **real-time, or near-real-time**, copies of the data.
## Journaling
Maintaining a meticulous record of every change made to an organization's data over time.
- Selecting the appropriate data tracking ganularity.
- Managing the journal's size and retention policies.
- Ensuring its security to prevent any kind of tampering.
