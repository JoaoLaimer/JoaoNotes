## Redundant Site
Alternative sites for backup in case the primary location encounters a failure or interruption
### Hot Site
A fully equipped backup facility ready to swiftly take over in case of a primary site failure or disruption.
- Cons: Expensive
- Pros: Ready to work 
Suited for mission-critical function.
### Warm Site
A partially equipped backup site that can become operational within days of a primary site disruption.
Warm sites may provide essential like power, phone lines, and network connectivity.
In a hybrid model, critical employees go to a hot site, while the rest relocate to a warm or cold site as part of the DRP.
### Cold Site
A site with no immediate equipment or infrastructure but can be transformed into a functional backup facility.
### Mobile Site
A versatile site that utilizes independent and portable units like trailers or tents to deliver recovery capabilities.
The key benefit of a mobile recovery site is is self-sufficiency.
### Virtual Site
Utilizes cloud-based environments and offers highly flexible approach to redundancy.
#### Virtual Hot Site
Fully replicated and instantly accessible
#### Virtual Warm site
Partially replicated and scalable.
#### Virtual Cold Site
Minimal activation to minimize costs.
## Platform Diversity
A vital aspect in redundant site design that uses different platform to prevent single points of failure in disaster recovery.
### Cloud-Provider Platform Diversity
Entails spreading resources across multiple cloud providers or regions, reducing the risk of a single platform outage.
