## Frame Risk
Risk management begins with establishing a risk context, i.e., framing risk. The purpose of risk framing is to develop a risk management strategy.
Organisations must define a risk frame to set the groundwork for managing risk and provide limits to risk-based decisions. To create a reasonable risk frame, organisations must identify the following:

- **Risk Assumptions**: What are the assumptions about threats and vulnerabilities? What is the likelihood of occurrence? What would be the impact and consequences?
- **Risk Constraints**: What are the constraints on assessing, responding, and monitoring risks?
- **Risk Tolerance**: What are the acceptable levels of risk? What is the acceptable degree of risk uncertainty?
- **Priorities and Trade-offs**: What are the high-priority business functions? What are the trade-offs among the different types of faced risks?

## Assess Risk
Risk assessment is the second part of risk management, which involves examining risks within the organisation’s risk framework.
The goal of the risk assessment is to determine the following:

- **Threats**: What are the threats that you need to consider?
- **Vulnerabilities**: What are the vulnerabilities that you have to deal with?
- **Impact**: What would be the impact if a threat exploited a vulnerability?
- **Likelihood**: What is the likelihood of this vulnerability being exploited?
## Risk Analysis
We have two approaches when it comes to risk analysis:

- **Qualitative Risk Analysis**, where we assign ratings to risks. The ratings can be a qualitative adjective, such as high, medium, and low. Alternatively, it can be something symbolic, such as red, yellow, and green.
- **Quantitative Risk Analysis**, where we assign monetary values and use that as a basis for decision-making.
### Qualitative Risk Analysis

As the name suggests, qualitative risk analysis uses qualitative adjectives to describe:
- Probability of a risk-taking place, i.e., probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability
- Impact of the risk, if realized, which can range between trivial to extreme.

### Quantitative Risk Analysis
#### Single Loss Expectancy

Using quantitative analysis, we need to assign monetary values and numeric percentages. Let’s start with the following equation:

**_SLE_ = _AssetValue_ × _EF_**

Where:
- **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)** is the loss incurred due to the realization of a threat represented as a monetary value.
- **Asset Value** is the monetary valuation of an asset
- **Exposure Factor (EF)** is the percentage of loss a realized threat can cause to an asset.
#### Annualized Loss Expectancy

However, this information is insufficient for us to decide on countermeasures. We need to find the expected loss per year.

**_ALE_ = _SLE_ × _ARO_**

Where:
- **Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)** is the loss the company expects to lose per year due to the threat.
- **Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)** is the expected number of times this threat is realized yearly, i.e., frequency per year.

 _ValueofSafeguard_ = _ALEbeforeSafeguard_ - _ALEafterSafeguard_ - _AnnualCostSafeguard_
## Respond to Risk
Risk management’s third component focuses on how organisations respond to the risks identified through risk assessment.
- **Avoid Risk**: If a company decides to eliminate the activity that leads to the risk, that would be risk avoidance. A bank might decide that all employees’ computers cannot access the Internet to protect its systems against all online threats. An organisation might instruct its employees to work exclusively using the workstations on its premises to prevent data from being stolen.
- **Transfer Risk**: A company might consider the risk too high to handle, so it decides to purchase insurance. That would be risk transference or risk sharing. A publishing house might buy insurance against fire, for instance.
- **Mitigate Risk**: A company might invest in countermeasures to reduce risk to an acceptable level; this would be risk mitigation. To protect against computer viruses, a company might install antivirus on all its computers instead of blocking access to the Internet and glueing the USB ports.
- **Accept Risk**: Sometimes, the countermeasure cost exceeds the loss incurred if the risk is realised.

## Monitor Risk
We need to keep monitoring risks. Many reasons dictate that we continue to monitor risk, even after an appropriate response has been implemented. The reasons include the following:

- Finding and adding new risks
- Eliminating risks that are no longer relevant
- Assessing our responses to existing risks

For the latter, monitoring risks activities requires a focus on the following areas:

- Effectiveness Monitoring
- Monitoring Change 
- Compliance Monitoring
