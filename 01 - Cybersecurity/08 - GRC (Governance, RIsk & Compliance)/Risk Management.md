#### Basic Terminology
- **Threat**: an intentional or accidental event that can compromise the security of an information system. Examples include hacking, phishing attacks, human error, and natural disasters.
- **Vulnerability**: a software, hardware, or network weakness that cybercriminals can exploit to gain unauthorised access or compromise a system.
- **Asset**: a valuable resource or component (tangible or intangible) that an organisation relies upon to achieve its objectives.
- **Risk**: the probability of a threat source exploiting an existing _vulnerability_ and resulting in adverse business effects.
- **Risk Management** (RM): the process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating risk to maintain acceptable levels.
## Risk Management
Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and responding to risks associated with a particular situation or activity. It involves identifying potential risks, assessing their likelihood and impact, evaluating possible solutions, and implementing the chosen solutions to limit or mitigate risk. It also involves monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of the solutions put in place.
A Risk Management Policy is a set of procedures and processes designed to minimize the chances of an adverse event or outcome for an organisation. It helps organisations identify, assess, and manage potential and actual risks related to their operations, financial activities, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The policy provides guidance on identifying and assessing risks, as well as assigning tasks and responsibilities to those involved in managing them.
**Information Systems Risk Management** is a system of policies, procedures, and practices that seek to protect a company’s computer system from various internal and external threats. It includes identifying threats, assessing the probability of their occurrence, and evaluating the effectiveness of various measures that can be taken to limit the damage they could cause. The process also involves determining the resources that should be allocated to respond to potential threats, as well as monitoring and maintaining the integrity of the system.

There are several frameworks for risk assessment. Example methodologies are:

- **[[NIST SP 800-30]]**: A risk assessment methodology developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It involves identifying and evaluating risks, determining the likelihood and impact of each risk, and developing a risk response plan.
- **Facilitated Risk Analysis Process (FRAP)**: A risk assessment methodology that involves a group of stakeholders working together to identify and evaluate risks. It is designed to be a more collaborative and inclusive approach to risk analysis.
- **Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE)**: A risk assessment methodology that focuses on identifying and prioritising assets based on their criticality to the organisation’s mission and assessing the threats and vulnerabilities that could impact those assets.
- **Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA)**: A risk assessment methodology commonly used in engineering and manufacturing. It involves identifying potential failure modes for a system or process and then analysing the possible effects of those failures and the likelihood of their occurrence.

## Supply Chain Risk Management
A supply chain is a sequence of suppliers that lead to the delivery of a product. In information systems, the product can be hardware, software, or service. Consequently, the risk is as follows:

- **Risk associated with hardware**: Depending on the importance of the target, a threat actor can add a hardware Trojan to an electronic device. As with software Trojans, the purpose is to provide unauthorised functionality.
- **Risk associated with software**: Software Trojans require access to the software to plant it. In the worst-case scenario, the attacker would succeed in adding the Trojan directly to the source code.
- **Risk associated with services**: The risk can range from downtime to data breaches. A company must ensure that the service provider has a good security program before using its service.
