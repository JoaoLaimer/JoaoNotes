The McCumber Cube is a model framework created by John McCumber in 1991 to help organizations establish and evaluate information security initiatives by considering all of the related factors that impact them. This security model has three dimensions:

1. The foundational principles for protecting information systems.
2. The protection of information in each of its possible states.
3. The security measures used to protect data.


**First Side (1)**
- **Confidentiality** is a set of rules that prevents sensitive information from being disclosed to unauthorized people, resources and processes. Methods to ensure confidentiality include **data encryption**, **identity proofing** and **two factor authentication**.
  
- **Integrity** ensures that system information or processes are protected from intentional or accidental modification. One way to ensure integrity is to use a **hash function** or **checksum**.
  
- **Availability** means that authorized users are able to access systems and data when and where needed and those that do not meet established conditions, are not. This can be achieved by **maintaining equipment**, **performing hardware repairs**, **keeping operating systems and software up to date**, and **creating backups**.

**Second Side(2)**
- **Processing** refers to data that is being used to perform an operation such as updating a database record (data in process).
  
- **Storage** refers to data stored in memory or on a permanent storage device such as a hard drive, solid-state drive or USB drive (data at rest).
  
- **Transmission** refers to data traveling between information systems (data in transit).

**Third Side(3)**

- **Awareness, training and education** are the measures put in place by an organization to ensure that users are knowledgeable about potential security threats and the actions they can take to protect information systems.
  
- **Technology** refers to the software- and hardware-based solutions designed to protect information systems such as firewalls, which continuously monitor your network in search of possible malicious incidents.
  
- **Policy and procedure** refers to the administrative controls that provide a foundation for how an organization implements information assurance, such as incident response plans and best practice guidelines.
